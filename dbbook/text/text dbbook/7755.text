Background
Greene initially formulated some of the ideas in The 48 Laws of Power while working as a writer in Hollywood and observing that today's power elite shared similar traits with powerful figures throughout history. [4] In 1995, Greene worked as a writer at Fabrica, an art and media school, and met a book packager named Joost Elffers. [6] [9] Greene pitched a book about power to Elffers and six months later, Elffers requested that Greene write a treatment. [6]
Although Greene was unhappy in his current job, he was comfortable and saw the time needed to write a proper book proposal as too risky. [11] However, at the time Greene was rereading his favorite biography about Julius Caesar and took inspiration from Caesar's decision to cross the Rubicon River and fight Pompey , thus inciting the Great Roman Civil War . [11] Greene would follow Caesar's example and write the treatment, which later became The 48 Laws of Power. [11] He would note this as the turning point of his life. [11]
Criticism
Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer said that Greene's so-called laws are based on isolated examples, and not on solid research. [4] Kirkus Reviews said Greene offers no evidence to support his world view, Greene's laws contradict each other, and the book is "simply nonsense". [12] Newsweek also points out ways the laws contradict each other and says "Intending the opposite, Greene has actually produced one of the best arguments since the New Testament for humility and obscurity." [13] Director magazine notes "some of Greene's 'laws' seem contradictory" and the work is "plodding and didactic". [14]
The 48 Laws of Power has sold over 1.2 million copies in the United States and has been translated into 24 languages. [6] Fast Company called the book a "mega cult classic," and The Los Angeles Times noted that The 48 Laws of Power turned Greene into a "cult hero with the hip-hop set, Hollywood elite and prison inmates alike." [6] [15] [16] [17] The book has been promoted in publications like CNN , Forbes , The Los Angeles Times , Entrepreneur magazine , The New York Times , The New Yorker , Newsweek , USA Today , The Guardian , Business Insider , Fast Company , ESPN , and Menâ€™s Health . [4] [6] [7] [9] [11] [15] [18] [19] [20] [21]
The 48 Laws of Power is one of the most requested books in American prison libraries, [4] [22] and is studied as a first year text in two US colleges. [23] [24] Former drug dealer Curtis Jackson (now best known as rapper 50 Cent ) stated that he related to the book "immediately," and approached Greene with the prospect of a potential collaboration, which would later become The 50th Law , another New York Times bestseller. [18] Busta Rhymes used The 48 Laws of Power to deal with problematic movie producers. [9] DJ Premier has a tattoo inspired from Law #5, "Reputation is the cornerstone of power", on his arm [5] and DJ Calvin Harris has an "Enter with boldness" arm tattoo based on Law #28. [25] The 48 Laws of Power has also been mentioned in songs by UGK , Jay Z , Kanye West , and Drake . [5] [26] [27] [28] Dov Charney , founder and CEO of American Apparel , frequently quotes the laws during board meetings, has given friends and employees copies of the book, and appointed Greene to the board of American Apparel. [6] Former Cuban President Fidel Castro is also reported to have read the book. [6]
