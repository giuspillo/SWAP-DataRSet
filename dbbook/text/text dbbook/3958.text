Plot introduction
That is the backstory. When the novel opens, Crimond has resurfaced, book nearly finished. His sudden appearance sets off a chain of events that nearly destroys the lives of everyone in the story.
Major themes
Crimond is a classic example of Murdoch's "enchanter" archetype: the charismatic, powerful man who inspires others to devote themselves to him, for reasons apparent to no one.
The Book and the Brotherhood is notable for its unusual emotional intensity, its finely-drawn characters, and the magnificent, wide-ranging opening scene, in which Crimond appears at an Oxford ball and every major character in the novel is introduced.
