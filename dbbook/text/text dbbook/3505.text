Plot summary
Mario Vega is seven years old and his life is about to change forever. Across the street in an exclusive suburb of Seville his father is splayed out dead on the kitchen floor, while his mother lies in bed upstairs, suffocated under her own pillow. It appears to be a suicide pact, but Inspector Jefe Javier FalcÃ³n has his doubts when he finds an enigmatic note crushed into the dead man's hand.
In the brutal summer heat FalcÃ³n begins to dismantle the obscure life of Rafael Vega only to receive threats from the Russian mafia, who have begun operating in the city. His investigation includes the neighbours: on one side a creative American couple with a destructive past and on the other a famous actor, whose only son is in prison for an appalling crime. Opposite lives Consuelo JimÃ©nez, who FalcÃ³n has met before when she was suspected of murdering her husband.
Within days two further suicides follow - one of them a senior policeman - while a forest fire rages through the hills above Seville, obliterating all in its path. And FalcÃ³n is left to sweat out the truth, which will reveal that everything is connected and that there is one more terrible secret in the black heart of Vega's life.
