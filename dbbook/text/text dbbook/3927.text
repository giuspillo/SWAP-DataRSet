The Storyteller (El Hablador) is a novel by Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa. The story tells of Saúl Zuratas, a university student who leaves civilization and becomes a "storyteller" for the Machiguenga native americans. The novel thematizes the Westernization of indigenous peoples through missions and through anthropological studies, and questions the perceived notion that indigenous cultures are set in stone.
Tasurinchi
Is a figure used throughout Llosa's book. During his storytelling, Mascarita uses "Tasurinchi" as a pronoun used to stand for oneself, other males, and even the sun. [1] Mascarita goes on to describe a personal encounter with an individual of the tribe. This individual, too, bears the name of Tasurinchi. Later, as Mascarita goes more "native," he adopts the name as a person pronoun, referring to himself as "Tasurinchi." [1]
Don Salomon Zuratas
Saul Zuratas's father. Converted to Judaism upon moving to the capital of Peru. After Don Salomon passes away, Saul leaves the city to become the story teller.
Major Themes, symbols, and motifs
The Storyteller by Mario Vargas Llosa is a novel that deals with displaced cultural identities and Peru's noncohesive diversity. Its major themes are the relationship between the global, national and tribal societies; the coexistence and codependence of center and periphery, the "first and third worlds"; cultural hybridism, miscegenation and transnationalism as the only possible way of survival in the modern world. The novel also questions the dichotomous relationship between the writer, as a modern autonomous subject, and the storyteller, as an already disappeared part of the collective experience. It explores different possibilities of a dialogue between the storyteller/novelist and his/her listener/reader.
To analyze the themes in a broader concept, Vargas asks the reader to think about the positive and negative effects of globalization, specifically through the roles of the Viracochas (White men, most typically used in negatively describing the ruthless rubber merchant of the rubber boom) and the missionaries. The Viracochas used the native Indians to harvest rubber, promising them food, shelter and goods to come work for them. The Viracochas treated the Indians horribly once they got to the camps and began pitting the tribes against each other once man power became scarce. They would send Mashcos to capture three Machiguengas or vice versa to buy their "freedom." "They wanted to Bleed us like they bled the trees.". [2] The Viracochas shed a negative light on globalization by exploiting the land and people for profit. Regarding the missionaries and linguists at the Summer Institute, the line between negative and positive impacts are blurred. By studying the Machiguengas, learning their language, and teaching them English and religion, some may argue that the native Indians are being saved from extinction in modern civilization. Others argue that the linguists and missionaries are a "tentacle of American imperialism which, under the conver of doing scientific research, has been engaged in gathering intelligence and has taken the first steps toward a neocolonist penetration of the cultures of the Amazonian Indian." [3] Through these examples of progress versus preservation, Llosa asks the reader, "which is more important?"
Cultural hybridism
The Storyteller is a novel on cultural conversion and the impossibility of the avoidance of hybridism. [4] Despite centuries of explicit or implicit attempts to Occidentalize and Christianize the indigenous tribes, in the eyes of the narrator they remain as "Handful of tragic, indomitable beings, that society has broken up into tiny families, fleeing, always fleeing, from the whites, from the mestizos, from the mountain people, and from other tribes, awaiting and stoically accepting their inevitable extinction as individuals and as a group, yet never giving up their language, their gods, their customs ". [5] As Vargas Llosa says himself: "It is tragic to destroy what is still living, still a driving cultural possibility, but I am afraid we shall have to make a choiceâ€¦ where there is such economic and social gap, modernization is possible only with the sacrifice of the Indian cultures". [6] In the book, native cultures are inseparable from society. The two main characters take different paths, the narrator to study in Florence, and Saul to attempt to join the Machiguengas, a native tribe. It is soon apparent that what Saul says is just a recreation of the story of Jesus Christ and the exodus of the Jews. Hybridism is the only answer, blending the sides and the middle; the new and the old must coexist, because what is lost cannot be returned
Cultural nomadism
The Machiguenga are described as "walkers". A vital aspect of their character is the nomadic nature of social tradition. This transient lifestyle informs their ability to learn from new experiences and encourages curiosity for other cultures. The narrator, Mario, begins to tell the story of Saul (who he suspects is Mascarita, the subject in the photograph). Through Saul's stories of his ethnological research, Mario illustrates the Amerindian general thirst for the unknown. This custom manifests as acceptance of the other. Despite his physical imperfections (and cultural differences), the Machiguenga accept Mascarita. The issue of cultural tradition and abomination are discussed and highlights this very idea of multi-cultural acceptance. Mascarita astutely remarks on the traditional killings of newborns that are born with imperfections. This tradition truly exemplifies Machiguenga respect for the foreigner. If Mascarita was native to the tribe, his birthmark would have led to his immediate demise. By allowing Mascarita to live and learn from their culture the Machiguenga implicitly accept him by sparing his life. This acceptance is guided by a tenet that is so essential to the fabric of their society; cultural nomadism.
Birthmark
Saul's birthmark is more of a symbol, but it still touches upon the theme of cultural hybridism. While Saul finds himself to be infatuated with the Machiguenga culture, his birthmark is essentially a constant reminder of the society from which he truly came. When interacting with Westerners, Saul gladly accepts any insults he is given that relate to the birthmark and even goes as far as to don the nickname "Mascarita," translating to "mask-face." When a drunk man calls him a monster and tells him to keep his face off the streets, Saul simply smiles and replies, "but if this is the only one I've got, what do you suggest I do?" (14). Despite this appearance of incivility, Saul finally gets relatively flustered when discussing the fact that the Machiguengas kill any newborns who are imperfect. Since Saul's face is scarred, he would not have made it into the Machiguenga society. The narrator notes that this was "the only time he ever alluded, not jokingly but seriously, even dramatically, to what was undoubtedly a tragedy in his life" (26). Since so many of his relationships in the past have been killed off by his imperfection, Saul seems most feared that his relationship with the Machiguengas will be marred by this permanent reminder of Western culture. That aside, the mark also helps accentuate the Machiguenga's practice of unity and collectivism, for in the end, they accept him as a person more than any Western culture did.
Storytelling
As indicated by the novel's title, storytelling is a very prominent theme in The Storyteller. After hearing about the special role of Hablador or Storyteller in Machiguenga culture, he is immediately intrigued by it. "They're a tangible proof that storytelling can be something more than mere entertainment... Something primordial, something that the very existence of a people may depend on. Maybe that's what impressed me so." (94). The author even goes on to say that stories are the essence of a culture and that SaÃºl's position as the Storyteller is a feat that requires penetrating the heart of the Machiguenga culture. In this way, The Storyteller can be seen as a work of metafiction on a self-aware level in the author's chapters and on an unconscious level in the Storyteller's chapters. Throughout the novel, both the author and the Storyteller question what it means to tell stories and why they are important. This is done through the questioning of the many different stories told in the novel. The stories SaÃºl tells the author, the stories the Storyteller tells the audience, and even the memories narrated by the author are questioned by the author as being inaccurate and heavily dependent on who is telling it.
Native myths
The parts of the novel narrated by the storyteller are mostly the accounts of the mythological figures in the Machiguenga culture. These native myths often do not have explicit lessons, but instead narrate the complicated Machiguenga mythology. The early parts of the novel begin with creation myths which explain the nomadic, non possessive nature of the Machiguenga people. As the novel progresses, however, the myths begin to relate to Jewish and Christian figures such as Jesus. Ultimately, it is revealed that the storyteller has begun to hybridize the native myths with Western stories and traditions.
Religion
Religion is one of the forefront motifs in The Storyteller. While the author's own religion is not explored deeply, he is shown to see religion as a system of rituals and this view is demonstrated early in the novel. "The Catholic religion was a breeze, a measly half-hour Mass every Sunday and Communion every first Friday of the month that was over in no time." (p. 9) This passage shows the author's view of religion as a ritual that requires effort rather than a strong belief system by which to live life.
Much more is written about SaÃºl's religion. As a Peruvian Jew , SaÃºl participates in holidays such as Sabbath and knows much about Judaism. However, he and his mother (who was a Jewish convert) would play games together to pass the time in the synagogue. Also, any other efforts put forth by SaÃºl to study Judaism are also efforts to please Don SalomÃ³n. Later in the story, the author hears that SaÃºl has left the University to study in Israel with his father. The author is skeptical of this news since SaÃºl was so invested in the Machinguenga culture. It is later revealed that SaÃºl has instead gone into the Amazonian jungle to live with the Machinguengas as their storyteller. At this role, SaÃºl hybridizes religious stories from the Bible with the native mythology, demonstrating his views of relativism.
Gregor Samsa
Gregor Samsa , the protagonist of Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis , is mentioned many times in the story as a motif. In The Metamorphosis, the protagonist Gregor Samsa wakes up transformed into a monstrous verminous bug. SaÃºl has read The Metamorphosis to a point where he "knew [it] by heart" (17). He even names his pet parrot Gregor Samsa, indicating an intimate association with the story. SaÃºl also makes several more references to Gregor Samsa throughout the novel whenever he speaks of something or someone out of the ordinary. For example, SaÃºl would refer to the Machiguenga disfigured babies (who would be killed by their mothers) as "Gregor Samsas" (25). He even uses that term as a way to bring attention to his own disfigurement, his birthmark. In the stories he tells, he eventually fuses the idea of the thunder god Tasurinchi with Gregor Samsa in the later chapters -- "Gregor-Tasurinchi"â€”as an example of his eventual cultural hybridism.
Academia
The academic world, represented in the novel by the University of San Marcos and the Summer Institute of Linguistics , is actively engaged by the author. He not only completes his studies at the University of San Marcos in Literature, but he also participates in expeditions done by the Summer Institute of Linguistics. In fact, it is revealed in the beginning that the author is in Italy "to read Dante and Machiavelli and look at Renaissance paintings for a couple of months in solitude." (4). The academic world is heavily criticized by SaÃºl Zuratas, however. In SaÃºl's view, academia is a means of aggressive Western proselytization. "Those apostolic linguists of yours are the worst of all. They work their way into the tribes to destroy them from within, just like chiggers." (p. 95) While SaÃºl himself is a student for the early part of the novel, he says that he is a student only to please Don SalomÃ³n. Ultimately, he leaves the University of San Marcos presumably for Israel. It is later revealed, however, that SaÃºl left to join the Machiguengas.
Author
Peruvian novelist, essayist, journalist and literary critic Mario Vargas Llosa was born in Arequipa, Peru, in 1936. He attended Leoncio Prado Military Academy from 1950 to 1952 and Colegio Nacional San Miguel de Piura (1952). From 1955 to 1957, he studied Literature and Law at the University of San Marcos. He completed his Ph.D. at the University of Madrid in 1959, writing his doctoral dissertation on Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Vargas Llosa's first renowned novel was La ciudad y los perros (The Time of the Hero, 1963), set in the Leoncio Prado Military Academy where the author had been a student before. The novel was immediately translated into many languages and received worldwide acclaim as well as several prestigious awards. In the 1960s, Mario Vargas Llosa became known for his innovative narrative techniques after publishing three novels of experimental form. Since the late 1960s Mario Vargas Llosa had been a visiting professor at many North American and European universities. In 1977 he was elected President of PEN Club International. In 1990 Vargas Llosa participated in presidential elections in Peru as a conservative candidate of the Democratic Front, but lost the election to Alberto Fujimori (Mario).
Development history
Mario Vargas Llosa made a journey into the Amazon Jungle in 1958. He felt that "The absence of law and institutions exposed the jungle natives to the worst humiliations and acts of injustice by colonists, missionaries and adventurers, who had come to impose their will through the use of terror and force.". Instead of finding the landscape exotic, he was faced with violence and cruelty of the native tribes. This trip into the jungle would be Llosa's inspiration for several of his novels, including The Storyteller. [7]
'The Storyteller' originally written in Spanish, was translated in 1989 by Helen Lane, translator for numerous authors of many different languages. Since its original publication 25 years ago, "The Storyteller has become a classic and is required reading for most anthropology students in the universities of the United States and South America". [8]
