Reception
Reviews were positiveÂ :
Penelope Lively in The Guardian wrote "Tragedy abounds in the novel, but such is its humanity and its wisdom that the effect is not dismaying, but somehow reassuring. Appalling things happen, and are done, but in the last resort ordinary decency somehow wins out. This is a fine book - an enthralling read, both straightforward and wonderfully intricate" [4]
Louise Doughty in The Independent finished with "Her Booker longlisting should be a source of joy for everyone tired of self-indulgent "look at me" writing. The Other Side of the Bridge is a beautiful read, on every level." [5]
Frances Taliaferro in The Washington Post wrote "The Other Side of the Bridge is an admirable novel. Its old-fashioned virtues were also apparent in Crow Lake - narrative clarity, emotional directness, moral context and lack of pretension - but Lawson has ripened as a writer, and this second novel is much broader and deeper. The author draws her characters with unobtrusive humor and compassion, and she meets one of the fiction writer's most difficult challenges: to portray goodness believably, without sugar or sentiment."
