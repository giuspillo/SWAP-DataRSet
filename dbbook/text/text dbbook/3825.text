Rand's fourth and last novel, it was also her longest, and the one she considered to be her magnum opus in the realm of fiction writing. Atlas Shrugged includes elements of romance, mystery, and science fiction, and it contains Rand's most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction. The book explores a dystopian United States where many of society's most productive citizens refuse to be exploited by increasing taxation and government regulations and disappear, shutting down their vital industries. The disappearances evoke the imagery of what would happen if the mythological Atlas refused to continue to hold up the world. They are led by John Galt. Galt describes the disappearances as "stopping the motor of the world" by withdrawing the minds that drive society's growth and productivity. In their efforts, these people "of the mind" hope to demonstrate that a world in which the individual is not free to create and profit is doomed, that civilization cannot exist where every person is a slave to society and government, and that the destruction of the profit motive leads to the collapse of society. The protagonist, Dagny Taggart, sees society collapse around her as the government increasingly asserts control over all industry. The novel's title is a reference to Atlas, a Titan of Greek mythology, who in the novel is described as "the giant who holds the world on his shoulders". The significance of this reference is seen in a conversation between the characters Francisco d'Anconia and Hank Rearden, in which d'Anconia asks Rearden what sort of advice he would give to Atlas upon seeing that "the greater [the titan's] effort, the heavier the world bore down on his shoulders". With Rearden unable to answer, d'Anconia gives his own response: "To shrug". The theme of Atlas Shrugged, as Rand described it, is "the role of man's mind in existence". The book explores a number of philosophical themes that Rand would subsequently develop into the philosophy of Objectivism. It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement. In doing so, it expresses many facets of Rand's philosophy, such as the advocacy of reason, individualism, capitalism, and the failures of government coercion. Atlas Shrugged received largely negative reviews after its 1957 publication, but achieved enduring popularity and consistent sales in the following decades.
Main article: Objectivism (Ayn Rand)
The story of Atlas Shrugged dramatically expresses Rand's philosophy of Objectivism: Rand's ethical egoism , her advocacy of " rational selfishness ", is perhaps her most well-known position. For Rand, all of the principal virtues and vices are applications of the role of reason as man's basic tool of survival (or a failure to apply it): rationality, honesty, justice, independence, integrity, productiveness, and pride â€” each of which she explains in some detail in "The Objectivist Ethics". [25] Rand's characters often personify her view of the archetypes of various schools of philosophy for living and working in the world. Robert James Bidinotto wrote, "Rand rejected the literary convention that depth and plausibility demand characters who are naturalistic replicas of the kinds of people we meet in everyday life, uttering everyday dialogue and pursuing everyday values. But she also rejected the notion that characters should be symbolic rather than realistic." [23] and Rand herself stated, "My characters are never symbols, they are merely men in sharper focus than the audience can see with unaided sight. . . .  My characters are persons in whom certain human attributes are focused more sharply and consistently than in average human beings." [23]
In addition to the plot's more obvious statements about the significance of industrialists to society, and the sharp contrast it provides to the Marxist version of exploitation and the labor theory of value , this explicit conflict is used by Rand to draw wider philosophical conclusions, both implicit in the plot and via the characters' own statements. Atlas Shrugged caricatures fascism , socialism and communism  â€” any form of state intervention in society â€” as fatally flawed. This includes any form of a welfare state: Rand suggests that every individual has to take complete responsibility for themselves. All government assistance is depicted as creating "moochers" by allowing poor people to "leech" the hard earned wealth of the rich and powerful. In addition, positions are expressed on a variety of other topics, including sex, politics, friendship, charity, childhood, and many others. Rand contends that the outcome of any individual's life is purely a function of their ability, and that any individual could overcome adverse circumstances, given ability and intelligence. Rand said it is not a fundamentally political book, but a demonstration of the individual mind's position and value in society. [26]
Sanction of the victim
The concept "sanction of the victim" is defined by Leonard Peikoff as "the willingness of the good to suffer at the hands of the evil , to accept the role of sacrificial victim for the ' sin ' of creating values". [27] Rand holds that evil is a parasite on the good and can only exist if the good tolerates it. Atlas Shrugged can be seen as an answer to the question of what would happen if this sanction were revoked. When Atlas shrugs, relieving himself of the burden of carrying the world, he is revoking his sanction.
Throughout Atlas Shrugged, numerous characters are frustrated by sanction of the victim. We first glimpse the concept when Hank Rearden feels he is duty-bound to support his family, despite their hostility towards him; later, the principle is stated explicitly by Dan Conway : "I suppose somebody's got to be sacrificed. If it turned out to be me, I have no right to complain". John Galt vows to stop the motor of the world by persuading the creators of the world to withhold their sanction: "Evil is impotent and has no power but that which we let it extort from us", and, "I saw that evil was impotent ... and the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it".
In Rand's view, morality requires we do not sanction our own victimhood. She assigns virtue to the trait of rational self-interest. However, Rand contends moral selfishness does not mean a license to do whatever one pleases, guided by whims. It means the exacting discipline of defining and pursuing one's rational self-interest. A code of rational self-interest rejects every form of human sacrifice, whether of oneself to others or of others to oneself.[ citation needed ]
Government and business
Atlas Shrugged endorses the belief that a society's best hope rests on adopting a system of pure laissez-faire . Rand's view of the ideal government is expressed by John Galt, who says, "The political system we will build is contained in a single moral premise: no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to physical force", and claims that "no rights can exist without the right to translate one's rights into reality â€” to think, to work and to keep the results â€” which means: the right of property". [28] Galt himself lives a life of laissez-faire capitalism as the only way to live consistently with his beliefs. [29]
In the world of Atlas Shrugged, society stagnates when independent productive achievers are socially demonized and even "punished" (by institutions such as taxation) for their accomplishments. [30] Independence and personal happiness had flourished to the extent that people were free, and achievement was rewarded to the extent that individual ownership of private property was strictly respected. This is in line with an excerpt from a 1964 interview with Playboy magazine in which Rand states "What we have today is not a capitalist society, but a mixed economy â€” that is, a mixture of freedom and controls, which, by the presently dominant trend, is moving toward dictatorship. The action in Atlas Shrugged takes place at a time when society has reached the stage of dictatorship. When and if this happens, that will be the time to go on strike, but not until then." [31]
Rand characterizes the actions of government employees in a way that is consistent with public choice theory , describing how in her view the language of altruism is used to pass legislation that is nominally in the public interest (e.g., the "Anti-Dog-Eat-Dog Rule", and "The Equalization of Opportunity Bill") but which in reality serves special interests and government agencies at the expense of the public and the producers of value. [32]
Property rights and individualism
"Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the leper's bell of an approaching looter." [33]
â€” Francisco d'Anconia, Atlas Shrugged
Rand's heroes must continually fight against "parasites", "looters", and "moochers" who demand the benefits of the heroes' labor. Edward Younkins describes Atlas Shrugged as "an apocalyptic vision of the last stages of conflict between two classes of humanity â€” the looters and the non-looters. The looters are proponents of high taxation, big labor, government ownership, government spending, government planning, regulation, and redistribution." [34]
"Looters" are Rand's depiction of bureaucrats and all forms of government officials, who confiscate others' earnings by force ("at the point of a gun") whose demands are backed by the implicit threat of force. Some officials are merely executing government policy, such as those who confiscate one state's seed grain to feed the starving citizens of another; others are exploiting those policies, such as the railroad regulator who illegally sells the railroad's supplies for his own profit. Both use force to take property from the people who "produced" or "earned" it.
"Moochers" are Rand's depiction of those who have no ability or work ethic whatsoever and are thus unable to produce value themselves. Therefore they demand others' earnings on behalf of the needy; however, they curse the producers who make that help possible and are jealous and resentful of the talented upon whom they depend. They are ultimately as destructive as the looters â€” destroying the productive through guilt, and appealing to "moral right" while enabling the "lawful" looting performed by governments.
Looting and mooching are seen at all levels of the world Atlas Shrugged portrays, from the looting officials Dagny Taggart must work around and the mooching brother Hank Rearden struggles with, to the looting of whole industries by companies such as Associated Steel and the mooching demands for foreign aid by the starving countries of Europe.
One of the novel's heroes, Francisco d'Anconia , indicates the role of "looters" in relation to money itself:
"So you think that money is the root of all evil? ... Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or the looters who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil? ... Not an ocean of tears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into bread you need to survive tomorrow. ... Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is men's protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values ... Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked: 'Account Overdrawn.'" [33]

(October 2013)
"Through Dagny's associations ... Rand illustrates what a relationship between two self-actualized, equal human beings can be ... Rand denies the existence of a split between the physical and the mental, the desires of the flesh and the longings of the spirit." [35]
â€“ Mimi Reisel Gladstein , Ayn Rand and Feminism: An Unlikely Alliance
In rejecting the traditional altruistic moral code , Rand also rejects the sexual code that, in her view, is the logical implication of altruism. In Atlas Shrugged Rand introduces a theory of sex that is based in her broader ethical and psychological theories. Rather than considering sexual desire a debasing animal instinct , Rand portrays it as the highest celebration of human values , a physical response to intellectual and spiritual values that gives concrete expression to what could otherwise be experienced only in the abstract.
In Atlas Shrugged, characters are sexually attracted to those who embody or seem to embody their values, be they higher or lower values by Rand's standards. Characters who lack clear purpose find sex devoid of meaning. This is illustrated in the contrasting relationships of Hank Rearden with Lillian Rearden and Dagny Taggart , by the relationships of James Taggart with Cherryl Brooks and with Lillian Rearden, and finally in the relationship between Dagny and John Galt .
Adultery is committed by three characters in the novel. The first and predominant act is of Hank Rearden, who sleeps with Dagny after the opening of the John Galt Line, to celebrate the success of his metal and her determination to have the line built. The affair continues for some time - even including a cross-country vacation for the two - until Hank's wife finds out; his wife does not want to divorce him, but instead wants to maintain her image as Mrs. Rearden and allows the affair to continue until Hank manipulates the judicial system to obtain a divorce. Later in the novel, as Mrs. Rearden knows the divorce will be processed shortly, she has sex with Dagny's brother James (who is also married, and despises Hank), as an act of revenge for them both against him. Having caught them, James' wife proceeds to commit suicide. Yet adultery is never addressed on moral grounds; the sex is addressed on its own, either as celebration of accomplishment or as an act of revenge.
Fictional technology and Atlas as science fiction
Technological progress and intellectual breakthroughs in scientific theory both figure prominently in Atlas Shrugged, leading some observers to classify Atlas in the genre of science fiction . Writer Jeff Riggenbach notes, "Galt's motor is one of the three inventions that propel the action of Atlas Shrugged", the other two being Rearden Metal and the government's sonic weapon, Project X. [36] Other fictional technologies included in the story are refractor rays (Gulch mirage), a sophisticated electrical torture device (the Ferris Persuader), voice activated door locks (Gulch power station), palm-activated door locks (Galt's New York lab), Galt's means of quietly turning the entire contents of his laboratory into a fine powder when a lock is breached, and a means of taking over all radio stations worldwide. Riggenbach adds, "Rand's overall message with regard to science seems clear: the role of science in human life and human society is to provide the knowledge on the basis of which technological advancement and the related improvements in the quality of human life can be realized. But science can fulfill this role only in a society in which human beings are left free to conduct their business as they see fit." [37]
Reception
Atlas Shrugged debuted on The New York Times Bestseller List at #13 three days after its publication. It peaked at #3 on December 8, 1957, and was on the list for 22 consecutive weeks. [9]
"Both conservatives and liberals were unstinting in disparaging the book; the right saw promotion of godlessness, and the left saw a message of greed is good. Rand is said to have cried every day as the reviews came out."
â€“ Harriet Rubin (2007) in The New York Times [10]
Atlas Shrugged was generally disliked by critics, despite being a popular success. The book was dismissed by some as an "homage to greed", while author Gore Vidal described its philosophy as "nearly perfect in its immorality". [10] Helen Beal Woodward, reviewing Atlas Shrugged for The Saturday Review , opined that the novel was written with "dazzling virtuosity" but that it was "shot through with hatred". [38] This was echoed by Granville Hicks , writing for The New York Times Book Review , who also stated that the book was "written out of hate". [39] The reviewer for Time magazine asked: "Is it a novel? Is it a nightmare? Is it Superman â€“ in the comic strip or the Nietzschean version?" [40] In the magazine National Review , Whittaker Chambers called Atlas Shrugged "sophomoric" and "remarkably silly", and said it "can be called a novel only by devaluing the term". [41] Chambers argued against the novel's implicit endorsement of atheism , whereby "Randian man, like Marxian man is made the center of a godless world". [41] Chambers also wrote that the implicit message of the novel is akin to "Hitler's National Socialism and Stalin's brand of Communism" ("To a gas chamber â€” go!"). [41]
The negative reviews produced responses from some of Rand's admirers, including a letter by Alan Greenspan to The New York Times Book Review, in which he responded to Hicks' claim that "the book was written out of hate" by saying, "... Atlas Shrugged is a celebration of life and happiness. Justice is unrelenting. Creative individuals and undeviating purpose and rationality achieve joy and fulfillment. Parasites who persistently avoid either purpose or reason perish as they should." [42] Greenspan had read unpublished drafts of the work in Rand's salon at least three years earlier. [43] In an unpublished [44] letter to the National Review, Leonard Peikoff wrote, "... Mr. Chambers is an ex-Communist. He has attacked Atlas Shrugged in the best tradition of the Communists â€” by lies, smears, and cowardly misrepresentations. Mr. Chambers may have changed a few of his political views; he has not changed the method of intellectual analysis and evaluation of the Party to which he belonged."
Positive reviews appeared in a number of publications. Richard McLaughlin, reviewing the novel for The American Mercury , compared it to Uncle Tom's Cabin in importance. [45] Well-known journalist and book reviewer John Chamberlain , writing in The New York Herald Tribune , found Atlas Shrugged satisfying on many levels: science fiction, a " Dostoevsky " detective story and, most importantly, a "profound political parable". [46] However, Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that "reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs"; one called it "execrable claptrap", while another said it showed "remorseless hectoring and prolixity". [47]
Former Rand business partner and lover Nathaniel Branden , to whom the book was originally dedicated, has expressed differing views of Atlas Shrugged. He was initially quite favorable to it, praising it in the book he and Barbara Branden wrote in 1962 called Who Is Ayn Rand? [48] After he and Rand ended their relationship in 1968, both he and Barbara Branden repudiated their book in praise of Rand and her novels. [49] As of 1971 though, in an interview he gave to Reason he listed some critiques, but concluded, "But what the hell, so there are a few things one can quarrel with in the book, so what? Atlas Shrugged is the greatest novel that has ever been written, in my judgment, so let's let it go at that." [50]
But in 1984, two years after Rand's death, he argued that Atlas Shrugged "encourages emotional repression and self-disowning" and that her works contained contradictory messages. Branden claimed that the characters rarely talk "on a simple, human level without launching into philosophical sermons". He criticized the potential psychological impact of the novel, stating that John Galt's recommendation to respond to wrongdoing with "contempt and moral condemnation" clashes with the view of psychologists who say this only causes the wrongdoing to repeat itself. [51]
Praise, criticism, influence, and renewed popularity
For more details on this topic, see Bibliography for Ayn Rand and Objectivism .
Over the years, Atlas Shrugged has attracted an energetic and committed fan base. Each year the Ayn Rand Institute donates 400,000 copies of works by Ayn Rand, including Atlas Shrugged, to high school students. [10] According to a 1991 survey done for the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club , Atlas Shrugged was situated between the Bible and M. Scott Peck 's The Road Less Traveled as the book that made the most difference in the lives of 5,000 Book-of-the-Month club members surveyed, with a "large gap existing between the #1 book and the rest of the list". [52] Modern Library 's 1998 nonscientific online poll of the 100 best novels of the 20th century [53] [54] found Atlas rated #1 although it was not included on the list chosen by the Modern Library board of authors and scholars. [55]
In 1997, the libertarian Cato Institute held a joint conference with The Atlas Society , an Objectivist organization, to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of the publication of Atlas Shrugged. [56] At this event, Howard Dickman of Reader's Digest stated that the novel had "turned millions of readers on to the ideas of liberty" and said that the book had the important message of the readers' "profound right to be happy". [56] In 2013 John Goedde , Chair of the Idaho Senate â€™s Education Committee, proposed that Atlas Shrugged be required reading for all Idaho high school students, with mandatory testing on the tome a requirement for high school graduation. Although legislation to that effect was introduced, the Senator had no plans to push the plan for adoption. [57]
The C-SPAN television series American Writers listed Rand as one of twenty-two surveyed figures of American literature, though primarily mentioning The Fountainhead rather than Atlas Shrugged. [58]
Rand's impact on contemporary libertarian thought has been considerable; the title of the libertarian magazine, Reason: Free Minds, Free Markets, is taken directly from John Galt, the hero of Atlas Shrugged, who argues that "a free mind and a free market are corollaries".
The Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises admired the unapologetic elitism he saw in Rand's work. In a private letter to Rand written a few months after the novel's publication, he declared, "... Atlas Shrugged is not merely a novel. It is also (or may I say: first of all) a cogent analysis of the evils that plague our society, a substantiated rejection of the ideology of our self-styled "intellectuals" and a pitiless unmasking of the insincerity of the policies adopted by governments and political parties ... You have the courage to tell the masses what no politician told them: you are inferior and all the improvements in your conditions which you simply take for granted you owe to the efforts of men who are better than you." [59]
Nobel Prize -winning economist and commentator Paul Krugman alluded to a quip [60] [61] by John Rogers in his blog: "There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs ." [60] [61] In his commentary Krugman has continually mocked those whose purportedly serious economic ideas come from the novel. [60] [62]
Besides Paul Krugman, conservatives , such as William Buckley, Jr. , strongly disapproved of Rand and her Objectivist message. [63] [64] Soon after the book's publication Buckley solicited a number of critical pieces: Russell Kirk called objectivism an â€œinverted religionâ€�, [63] Frank Meyer accused Rand of â€œcalculated crueltiesâ€� and her message, an â€œarid subhuman image of manâ€�, [63] Garry Wills regarded Rand a â€œfanaticâ€� [63] and Whittaker Chambers considered the story of Atlas Shrugged preposterous, its characters crude caricatures, its message dictatorial and overall, "a remarkably silly book". [63] [64]
"I know from talking to a lot of Fortune 500 C.E.O.'s that Atlas Shrugged has had a significant effect on their business decisions, even if they don't agree with all of Ayn Rand's ideas."
â€“ John A. Allison , former CEO of BB&T [10]
In the late 2000s, the book gained more media attention and conservative commentators suggested the book as a warning against a socialistic reaction to the finance crisis. Conservative commentators Neal Boortz , [65] Glenn Beck , and Rush Limbaugh [66] have offered high praise of the book on their respective radio and television programs. In 2006 Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Clarence Thomas cited Atlas Shrugged as among his favorite novels. [67] Republican Congressman John Campbell said for example: "People are starting to feel like we're living through the scenario that happened in [the novel] ... We're living in Atlas Shrugged", echoing Stephen Moore in an article published in The Wall Street Journal on January 9, 2009, titled "Atlas Shrugged From Fiction to Fact in 52 Years". [68] In 2005 Congressman Paul Ryan said that Rand was "the reason I got into public service" and later required his staff members to read Atlas Shrugged. [69] [70] In April 2012 he disavowed such beliefs however, calling them "an urban legend", and rejected Rand's philosophy. [71]
BioShock , the critically acclaimed 2007 videogame is widely considered to be a deconstruction of Atlas Shrugged. The story depicts a collapsed Objectivist society, with the player learning of how it fell apart after the fact. The game features Objectivism as its central theme and even goes so far as to give the characters names that are connected with the book. Examples of this include Atlas , Andrew Ryan (a play on the name Ayn Rand) and Alisa Rosenbaum (Rand's birth name). When asked about the influences for BioShock, the creator of the game, Ken Levine , replied, "I have my useless liberal arts degree, so I've read stuff from Ayn Rand and George Orwell, and all the sort of utopian and dystopian writings of the 20th century, which I've found really fascinating." [72]
Sales of Atlas Shrugged have increased since the 2007 financial crisis , according to The Economist magazine and The New York Times . The Economist reported that the fifty-two-year-old novel ranked #33 among Amazon.com's top-selling books on January 13, 2009 and that its thirty-day sales average showed the novel selling three times faster than during the same period of the previous year. With an attached sales chart, The Economist reported that sales "spikes" of the book seemed to coincide with the release of economic data. Subsequently, on April 2, 2009, Atlas Shrugged ranked #1 in the "Fiction and Literature" category at Amazon and #15 in overall sales. [73] [74] [75] Total sales of the novel in 2009 exceeded 500,000 copies. [76] The book sold 445,000 copies in 2011, the second-strongest sales year in the novel's history. At the time of publication, the novel was on The New York Times best-seller list and was selling at roughly a third the volume of 2011. [77]
Film and television adaptations
Main articles: Atlas Shrugged: Part I , Atlas Shrugged: Part II , and Atlas Shrugged: Part III
A film adaptation of Atlas Shrugged was in " development hell " for nearly 40 years. [78] In 1972, Albert S. Ruddy approached Rand to produce a cinematic adaptation. Rand agreed that Ruddy could focus on the love story. "That's all it ever was," Rand said. [1] [2] [3] Rand insisted on having final script approval, which Ruddy refused to give her, thus preventing a deal. In 1978, Henry and Michael Jaffe negotiated a deal for an eight-hour Atlas Shrugged television miniseries on NBC . Michael Jaffe hired screenwriter Stirling Silliphant to adapt the novel and he obtained approval from Rand on the final script. However, in 1979, with Fred Silverman's rise as president of NBC, the project was scrapped. [79]
Rand, a former Hollywood screenwriter herself, began writing her own screenplay, but died in 1982 with only one-third of it finished. She left her estate, including the film rights to Atlas, to her student Leonard Peikoff , who sold an option to Michael Jaffe and Ed Snider . Peikoff would not approve the script they wrote, and the deal fell through. In 1992, investor John Aglialoro bought an option to produce the film, paying Peikoff over $1 million for full creative control. [79]
In 1999, under Aglialoro's sponsorship, Ruddy negotiated a deal with Turner Network Television (TNT) for a four-hour miniseries, but the project was killed after the AOL Time Warner merger. After the TNT deal fell through Howard and Karen Baldwin obtained the rights while running Phillip Anschutz 's Crusader Entertainment . The Baldwins left Crusader and formed Baldwin Entertainment Group in 2004, taking the rights to Atlas Shrugged with them. Michael Burns of Lions Gate Entertainment approached the Baldwins to fund and distribute Atlas Shrugged. [79] A draft screenplay was written by James V. Hart [80] and re-written by Randall Wallace , [81] but was never produced.
In May 2010, Brian Patrick O'Toole and Aglialoro wrote a screenplay, intent on filming in June 2010. Stephen Polk was set to direct. [82] However, Polk was fired and principal photography began on June 13, 2010 under the direction of Paul Johansson and produced by Harmon Kaslow and Aglialoro. [83] This resulted in Aglialoro's retention of his rights to the property, which were set to expire on June 15, 2010. Filming was completed on July 20, 2010, [84] and the movie was released on April 15, 2011. [85] Dagny Taggart was played by Taylor Schilling and Hank Rearden by Grant Bowler . [86]
The film was met with a generally negative reception from professional critics, getting an 11% (rotten) rating on movie review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , [87] and had less than $5 million in total box office receipts. [88] The producer and screenwriter John Aglialoro blamed critics for the film's paltry box office take and said he might go on strike. [89]
However, on February 2, 2012, Kaslow and Aglialoro announced Atlas Shrugged: Part II was fully funded and that principal photography was tentatively scheduled to commence in early April 2012. [90] The film was released on October 12, 2012, [91] without a special screening for critics. [92] It suffered one of the worst openings ever, 98th worst according to Box Office Mojo , among films in wide release. [93] Final box office take was $3.3 million, well under that of Part I despite the doubling of the budget to $20 million according to the Daily Caller. Those figures should be treated as tentative as the Internet Movie Database estimates Part 1 budget at $20 million and the Part II budget at $10 million, while Box Office Mojo says Part 1 cost $20 million and Part 2 data is "NA". [94] [95] Critics gave the film a 5% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 21 reviews. [96]
The third part in the series, Atlas Shrugged: Part III , is scheduled to be released on July 4, 2014. [97]
In popular culture
In Mad Men , season 1, episode 8 ("The Hobo Code"), Bert Cooper urges Don Draper to read the book, and Don's sales pitch tactic to cosmetics client Belle Jolie indicates he's been influenced by the "individuals of mind" on strike plot: "If you don't appreciate my hard work, then I will take it away and we'll see how you do."
In the animated television show South Park , episode "Chickenlover", newly literate Officer Barbrady gave up on reading after experiencing Atlas Shrugged. [98]
The 2007 survival horror game Bioshock took many of its story and elements from this novel. [72]
Atlas Shrugged is briefly featured in the film Men in Black during the morgue scene with David Cross.
In One Tree Hill , season 1, episode 2 ("The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most"), Jake Jagielski gives Lucas Scott a copy of Atlas Shrugged to read. [98]
The Futurama episode "I Second That Emotion" contains a library of books flushed down to the sewers, to be read only by grotesque mutants. Bender looks through it, sees Atlas Shrugged, and dismisses it as "nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand". [98]
In The Pagemaster , after Richard Tyler crash-lands into a mountain in the Fantasy Section, the large book that falls on top of him is a version of Atlas Shrugged.
