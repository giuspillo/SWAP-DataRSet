Plot summary
Seven years after the events of Heroes Die , Hari Michaelson (also known as Caine) is a puppet executive on the Studio he used to work for. He is now a paraplegic and lives with his wife Shanna and her daughter Faith. He uncovers a plot by Earth's executives to infect Overworld with a plague of HRVP (an especially virulent form of rabies) that would clear the way for colonization of Earth's crowded population into the new world and an exploitation of its resources. In addition to Michaelson the story also details a number of other characters, including Hari's academy friend Kris Hansen, the former Overworld god Tan'elKoth (the former Ma'elKoth now exiled to Earth) and Raithe, a young Monastic adept obsessed with killing Caine.
Through Hell and Highwater, Caine must work his way through Home and try to avert the infection, save the girl, beat a god and restore a friend. No one said it would be easy.
