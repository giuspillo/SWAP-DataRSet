Elephants Can Remember is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in November 1972 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year. The UK edition retailed for £1.60 and the US edition at $6.95. It features her Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and the recurring character Ariadne Oliver. This was the last of Christie's novels to feature either of these characters, although in terms of publication it was succeeded by Curtain: Poirot’s Last Case, which had been written in the early 1940s. The novel is notable for its concentration on memory and oral testimony.
Plot summary
At a literary luncheon a complete stranger, Mrs. Burton-Cox, asked the celebrated author Ariadne Oliver a blunt question. Her son was considering marriage to one of Oliverâ€™s goddaughters, Celia Ravenscroft. Her question was: did Celiaâ€™s mother murder her father, or was it the other way around?
The bodies of General Alistair Ravenscroft and his wife were found near their manor house in Overcliffe. Both had bullet wounds. A revolver with only their fingerprints was left between them. The original investigation could not prove whether the case was a double suicide or murder/suicide and, if the latter, who killed whom. The couple's two children were left behind, including daughter Celia.
At a literary luncheon twelve years later Mrs. Burton-Cox, to whose son Celia was engaged, approached Mrs. Ariadne Oliver, a school friend of the late Margaret Ravenscroft and godmother to her daughter Celia. Mrs. Burton-Cox asked Mrs. Oliver what she appeared to believe was a very important question: which of Celia's parents was the murderer, and which was murdered?
Initially offended by the woman's brazen, impolite attitude Oliver consulted with Celia, who had no knowledge about their deaths as she was away at school, and was herself unsure about marrying Burton-Coxâ€™ son. She added that there were three others at her parentsâ€™ home then: an almost blind housekeeper, an au pair attending her mother, and an old aunt â€œWhom I never loved much.â€� Later we learned about an â€œangry gardener.â€� Celia said she was old enough now to learn how her parents died, and trusted her godmother to keep the findings from Burton-Cox.
Oliver decided to try to resolve the issue, so she invited her friend Hercule Poirot to help her solve the disquieting puzzle. They separately interviewed several elderly witnesses whom they termed â€œelephantsâ€�, based on the assumption that like the proverbial elephants, they had long memories. Each "elephant" remembered (or mis-remembered) a very different set of circumstances.
Poirot started with his long-time colleague Superintendent Spence, who brought along Inspector Garroway, who investigated the Ravenscroft murders. Poirot heard that although they had a dog, the dog did not accompany them on the fatal walk. Garroway thought the suicide option â€œhad something wrong about it.â€� Poirot asked how the two sisters liked each other.
Oliver pursued her own interviews.
She began with Julia Carstairs, a very old acquaintance. Carstairs remembered the couple well: seemed normal, a stable family life, Lady Ravenscroft rotated among four wigs and used much make-up, and no motive for suicide, yet she spoke to Carstairs of â€œstarting a new life.â€� She remembered that the General had a young secretary and perhaps was too close to her.
Mrs. Matcham, Oliverâ€™s old nanny (and Ravenscroftâ€™s) said the either the General or his wife had a sister who â€œtook a baby from a pram and threw her into the river.â€� She had been â€œin a mental placeâ€� before then. Later after her release she came to live with the Ravenscrofts, but had not been there for quite a while before the deaths. (Celiaâ€™s aunt?) She thought the gardener or an outsider did it.
When she talked to her old housekeeper, Mrs. Buckle, she learned that Lady Ravenscroft was not fond of her half-sister (â€œa troublemakerâ€�), who nevertheless visited them occasionally, and borrowed money. Her son â€œwas shifty.â€� Lady R had a tutor (Edward) for her son, and â€œhad much in common with him.â€� â€œThere was talk here and there (about a boyfriend or girlfriend), but it was all nonsense.â€� Both Ravenscrofts â€œwere in good healthâ€� and she did not believe they would commit suicide. Lady R went into the hospital for â€œan operation of some kindâ€� and came back â€œshe looked very much younger... (Having had) a lot of face treatment.â€� Oliver surmised that this treatment (perhaps for Cancer) caused her hair to fall out, hence the wigs.
When Poirot and Oliver compared notes, Oliver was concerned about the probable inaccuracies in the memories of elephants. Poirot said, â€œThey could be not true but still be of use.â€� For example, the rumors of romantic links for the General and his Lady were often repeated but unsubstantiated. He pointed to two possibly significant facts among the clutter of memories: Margaret Ravenscroftâ€™s four wigs at the time of her death, and that a few days before her death the otherwise-devoted family dog seriously bit her.
The son of Mrs. Burton-Cox, Desmond, visited Poirot to ask him to resolve the deaths so Celia would marry him. Desmond gave him the names and addresses of Celiaâ€™s two French governesses to add information on what happened. Desmond added that he was adopted, and also that he thought some tragic accident happened when Lady Ravenscroft went into the hospital. Zelie, one of the governesses, came back to visit Lady Ravenscroft when she went into the hospital.
By questioning Inspector Garroway Poirot learned:
Poirotâ€™s hunch was confirmed: Lady Ravenscroft, Margaret (Molly), had an identical twin sister Dorothea (Dolly). Molly generally led an unremarkable life, presented to the Queen, and marrying General Ravenscroft.
Dolly had previously been connected with two violent incidents and had spent protracted periods of her life in psychiatric nursing homes. She had married Major Jarrow and, shortly after his death in India, her infant son drowned in an accident; a nine-year old girl was suspected. Some thought Dolly had done it. Her grief led her into a mental hospital. A second murder was committed in Malaya while Dolly was staying with the Ravenscrofts; it was an attack on the child of a neighbor.
While staying with the Ravenscrofts at Overcliffe, an over-medicated Dolly sleepwalked off a cliff and died on the evening of September 15. Molly and her husband died three weeks later, on October 3.
Poirot met Celia, and then Mrs. Burton-Cox. When challenged by Poirot, Celia reiterated her desire to know the truth, admitting that she knew precious little about her parents. Her character impressed Poirot. Mrs. Burton-Cox was surprised to meet Poirot at Oliverâ€™s house, repeated her desire to learn more about the family of her potential son-in-law, and fled quickly before he could ask her questions. He thought she had hoped Oliver would pry the information out of Celia, without involving a detective, or had something deeper to hide. He found her unlikeable, and decided that he must delve deeper into the past in order to unearth the truth.
Oliver learned from the wig manufacturer that Ravenscroft sent her French governess to her to order two new wigs, about three weeks before the deaths. The seller did think it unusual to own four wigs.
Poirotâ€™s agent, Mr. Goby, investigated the Burton-Cox family. He discovered that Desmond (who knows that he was adopted, but has no details about the adoption or his origins) was the illegitimate son of a now-deceased actress, Kathleen Fenn, with whom Mrs. Burton-Coxâ€™s husband had conducted an affair. Fenn had left Desmond a considerable personal fortune, which would, under the terms of his will, be left to his adoptive mother were he to die. Mrs. Burton-Coxâ€™s attempt to prevent Desmond getting married to Celia Ravenscroft was thus an unlovely attempt to obtain the use of his money; there was no suggestion that she planned to kill him and inherit the money.
Poirot suspected the truth, but substantiated it only after he traveled to Lausanne to speak to ZÃ©lie Meauhourat, the governess employed by the Ravenscrofts at the time of their death. She had promised General Ravenscroft to keep the truth confidential, and only Poirotâ€™s insistence that Celia and her fiancÃ© both deeply wanted to know the truth brought her story forward. She returned with him to England, where she explained the truth to Desmond and Celia, with Mrs. Oliver present. Dolly had fatally injured her identical twin Molly as they walked along the cliff as part of a psychotic episode, but such was Mollyâ€™s love for her sister that in her dying moments she made her husband promise to protect Dolly from the police. Accordingly ZÃ©lie and the General made it appear that Dollyâ€™s was the corpse found at the foot of the cliff, and that Molly went suddenly into the hospital due to sadness about Dolly. Dolly took her sisterâ€™s place, purchasing two more concealing wigs and then playing the role of Molly to the servants. Only the Ravenscroftsâ€™ dog knew the difference, hence why it bit its "mistress." After three weeks the General committed suicide after killing Dolly in order to prevent her from injuring anyone else. Poirot added that Mrs. Burton-Cox sought to dissuade her adopted son from marrying an independent minded woman so she herself could control the wealth.
Desmond and Celia recognized the sadness of the true events, but knowing the facts were able to face a future together, and married shortly.

Literary significance and reception
Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 5 November 1972 said, "A quiet but consistently interesting whodunnit with ingenious monozygotic solution. Any young elephant would be proud to have written it." [4]
Robert Barnard : "Another murder-in-the-past case, with nobody able to remember anything clearly, including, alas, the author. At one time we are told that General Ravenscroft and his wife (the dead pair) were respectively sixty and thirty-five; later we are told he had fallen in love with his wife's twin sister 'as a young man'. The murder/suicide is once said to have taken place ten to twelve years before, elsewhere fifteen, or twenty. Acres of meandering conversations, hundreds of speeches beginning with 'Well, â€¦' That sort of thing may happen in life, but one doesn't want to read it." [5]
"Elephants Can Remember" has been criticised as of lower quality than the bulk of Christie's output. According to The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English, this novel is one of the "execrable last novels" where Christie "loses her grip altogether". [6]
Elephants Can Remember was cited in a study done in 2009 using computer science to compare Christie's earlier works to her later ones. The sharp drops in vocabulary size and increases in repeated phrases and indefinite nouns suggested Christie may have been suffering from Alzheimer's disease . The subject of the book being about memory may be another clue. [7]
References to other works
The character of Superintendent Spence had previously appeared in Taken at the Flood , Mrs McGinty's Dead and Hallowe'en Party . The last two of these cases are discussed in Chapter 5 of the novel, along with the case retold in Five Little Pigs .
Mr Goby is a recurring character in many of the later Poirot novels. Although he had not appeared personally in the previous novel, Hallowe'en Party he is mentioned as having contributed to that investigation in Chapter 21 of that novel.
In Chapter 3, Mrs Oliver fondly recalls a copy of the book Enquire Within Upon Everything that had been owned by her Aunt Alice. This is also the book in a copy of which a will had been concealed in Hallowe'en Party. The book is best remembered today, however, as the inspiration for a program called ENQUIRE written in 1980 by Tim Berners-Lee and which anticipated the functionality of wikis . [8]
In the Miss Marple story A Murder is Announced , the character Edmund Swettenham, a writer, announces a play he has written after the murder is solved, similarly titled Elephants Do Forget. Its author described it as "a roaring farce in three acts". [9]
Adaptation
The novel was adapted into a TV film with David Suchet as Poirot, as part of the final series of Agatha Christie's Poirot . It was broadcast on ITV on 9 June 2013. [10] ZoÃ« Wanamaker returned to the role of Ariadne Oliver , marking her fifth out of six appearances on the show in total. Greta Scacchi (Mrs Burton-Cox), Vanessa Kirby (Celia Ravenscroft), Iain Glen (Dr Willoughby) and Ferdinand Kingsley (Desmond Burton-Cox) were also among the cast.
The adaptation is generally faithful to the novel, but includes some significant additions to the plot. Most notably, there is a gruesome present day murder for Poirot to solve, which raises the tension and allows for a suspenseful ending. The plot of the novel, involving delving into the past, is reduced to background information leading to the present day murder. Characters such as Mr Goby, Miss Lemon, George, Marlene Buckle (whose mother becomes Mrs Matcham's housekeeper) and ex-Chief Superintendent Spence were removed from the story (Spence's character is replaced with an original character named Beale), whilst the characters of ZÃ©lie Meauhourat and Mme Rouselle were combined. Instead of immediately helping Mrs Oliver with the Ravenscroft case, Poirot instead chooses to investigate the murder of Dr Willoughby's father, which is a subplot that is not in the novel; as a consequence, Dr Willoughby's character is greatly expanded. When Poirot realises that Dr Willoughby and his institute have a connection to the Ravenscrofts, Poirot decides to solve both mysteries. This subplot also includes an original character named Marie McDermott, an Irish-American girl who works as Dr Willoughby's filing clerk and turns out to be his mistress. The character is ultimately revealed to be Dorothea Jarrow's daughter, who is avenging her mother for the cruel treatments she experienced at the hands of Professor Willoughby (an entirely fictional version of hydrotherapy ), and also for her mother's murder (as she was at Overcliffe on the day of the tragedy and overheard General Ravenscroft make his plans) by trying to kill both Celia and Desmond. ZÃ©lie spirited her away to Canada after the tragedy, and she had to wait thirteen years before she could earn enough money to travel to England and exact her revenge. Also, in keeping with the other episodes, the story is moved from the early 1970s to the late 1930s.
