Soldier of Sidon is a 2006 fantasy novel [1] by Gene Wolfe .
It forms the third part of the Soldier (or Latro) series of books, with two prequels Soldier of the Mist (1986) and Soldier of Arete (1989). Soldier of Sidon continues the adventures of the Soldier series's protagonist, Latro, in Egypt at the time of the Achaemenid Empire .
Plot
This book continues with the conceit of the earlier two books of having the tale arising from the translation of scrolls discovered in the present day, allegedly written in Latro's own hand.
Latro suffered a head wound as a mercenary in the army of the Persian King Xerxes at the Battle of Plataea . As Tony Keen in his review [2] states: Latro cannot recall events of more than a day, but on the other hand, he can see gods and demigods. In this book, the gods and demigods encountered by Latro and his companions, in their journey up the Nile in a search for a cure to his affliction, are Egyptian and African, rather than the Greek ones of the two earlier books.
Reception
Well received on its publication, the novel was winner in 2007 of the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. [3]
The novel also received 3rd place in the Fantasy Novel category of the 2007 Locus Awards . [4]
