Prisoner's Base (British title Out Goes She) is a Nero Wolfe detective novel by Rex Stout, first published by Viking Press in 1952.
Plot introduction
As far as I know, no electrons had darted in either direction when I first laid eyes on Priscilla Eads, nor had I felt faint or dizzy at any point during my association with her, but the fact remains that I have never had swifter or stronger hunches than the two that were connected with her. Monday evening, before Helmar had said much more than twenty words about his missing ward, I had said to myself, "She's upstairs," and knew it. Tuesday morning, when I saw Inspector Cramer of Manhattan Homicide on the stoop, I said to myself, "She's dead," and knew it.
â€” Archie, reflecting, in Prisoner's Base, chapter 3.
A young woman who will shortly inherit control of a large manufacturing firm wants to rent a room in Nero Wolfe's house. Wolfe, outraged, puts her out; she is found murdered later that night. With no client in sight, Wolfe is not interested, but Archie feels responsible. His first step is to crash a meeting of the manufacturer's board of directors.
The 1992 Bantam edition reprints the typewritten title page of Rex Stout's 1952 manuscript, showing that the book's original title was Dare-Base. Dare-Base is a children's game, a variation on tag, also called prisoner's base [1] Late one night, Archie muses that the situation faced by one of the characters is like the game â€” it's up to her to get from one base to another without being tagged. But she does get tagged.
Plot summary
Collins Crime Club released the first British edition of Prisoner's Base in 1953, as Out Goes She
Following an argument between Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin over Goodwinâ€™s weekly paycheck, a young woman arrives at Wolfeâ€™s brownstone with a suitcase and an unusual request; she wants to rent a room for the week on the condition that her identity and presence remain secret. In order to bring some money into the household funds -- and to annoy Wolfe -- Archie agrees to bring the womanâ€™s request to Wolfeâ€™s consideration. Although Wolfe rejects the idea out of hand, before Archie can have the woman removed Wolfe is approached by Perry Helmar, a lawyer who wants to hire Wolfe to find his ward , Priscilla Eads, who has disappeared one week before her twenty-fifth birthday.
From the description Helmar provides, Archie realizes that their houseguest is Priscilla Eads. Wolfe does not accept Helmarâ€™s job immediately, but instead offers to house Eads if she will pay the $10,000 fee that he would have otherwise received from Helmar. When Eads refuses, Wolfe has Archie remove her from the brownstone on the promise that he will not accept Helmarâ€™s job nor start looking for her until the following morning. The next morning, before Wolfe can accept Helmarâ€™s proposal, Inspector Cramer arrives at the brownstone and informs Archie that Priscilla Eads has been murdered, with Archieâ€™s fingerprints found on her luggage. On top of Eadsâ€™ death, her maid Margaret Fomos was also murdered, and as Eads was strangled in her own apartment the police have assumed that the killer murdered Fomos to steal her keys and to conceal his identity.
With no fee in sight, Wolfe refuses to involve himself in the matter. Feeling guilty over letting Eads go to her death, Archie is infuriated by Wolfeâ€™s attitude and storms out of the brownstone to begin his own investigation. He arrives at the Snowdown corporation , a towel manufacturer that Eads would have inherited a controlling stake in on her twenty-fifth birthday, and infiltrates an executive meeting by allowing those present to believe he is a police detective. He learns that the stock Eads would have inherited will instead be divided between the chief officers of the corporation, including Perry Helmar, before the meeting is interrupted by Lieutenant Rowcliffe of the NYPD , who exposes Archie and arrests him.
Assuming that Archie is acting on behalf of Wolfe, in a moment of over-zealousness Rowcliffe also has Wolfe arrested and brought to the district attorney . Although the mistake is soon cleared up, Wolfe is outraged by Rowcliffeâ€™s actions and insolent attitude and informs the authorities that Archie is now his client; he intends to solve Priscilla Eadsâ€™ murder. As Helmar and the Snowdown executives are potential suspects with no reason to trust Wolfe or Archie, Wolfe orders Archie to find some leverage by interviewing Sarah Jaffee, a childhood friend of Eads and a young war widow who has been deeply traumatized by her grief over her husbandâ€™s death while fighting in Korea earlier that year.
Although Jaffee is reluctant to involve herself in the corporate affairs of Snowdown, Archie earns her gratitude by disposing of her late husbandâ€™s hat and coat, a task that Jaffee had been unable to bring herself to do. As a result of Archie's act of kindness, Wolfe manages to persuade her to initiate legal action enjoining the Snowdown executives from exercising ownership of the stock they will inherit until it is determined that none of them have any involvement in the death of either Eads or Margaret Fomos. The threat of injunction is sufficient to bring the Snowdown officers to Wolfe, but they are joined by an unexpected visitor -- Eric Hagh, Priscilla Eadsâ€™ ex-husband, who produces a document apparently signed by Eads which he claims gives him a valid claim on Eadsâ€™ inheritance.
After the meeting, Archie receives a late night phone call from Sarah Jaffee, who appears to have mislaid her keys. Seeing the similarity of the situation to the murder of Priscilla Eads, Archie urges her to leave the apartment and rushes to meet her, but by the time he arrives she has been murdered. Further angered and guilt-ridden over Jaffeeâ€™s death, Archie convinces the police to allow him to assist in the investigation, but attempts to interrogate those present at Wolfeâ€™s meeting prove fruitless. Archie discovers that Wolfe has given Saul Panzer a large sum of money to conduct his own investigation. Frustrated and out of ideas, the authorities reluctantly convince Archie to persuade Wolfe to re-enact the meeting at his office.
To Archieâ€™s surprise, Wolfe agrees to the idea, but before the re-enactment can commence Wolfe announces that he will instead identify the murderer. He reveals that the assumption that Margaret Fomos was murdered to prevent her from revealing the killerâ€™s identity was flawed; instead of murdering the three women to prevent his identity from being exposed, the murderer in fact killed them because he knew that they would not be able to identify him. Wolfe reveals evidence uncovered by Saul Panzer that the man calling himself Eric Hagh is in fact Siegfried Muecke, a gambler who stole Haghâ€™s identity after Hagh died in an avalanche in the Andes . Muecke intended to claim Haghâ€™s inheritance for himself and murdered Fomos, Eads and Jaffee because all three women knew what Eric Hagh really looked like and would immediately realize that he was an impostor . The novel ends with Muecke under arrest and Wolfe turning his attention to another thorny matter -- whether, as his 'client', Archie owes him a fee.
The unfamiliar word
In most Nero Wolfe novels and novellas, there is at least one unfamiliar word, usually spoken by Wolfe. Prisoner's Base contains these three:
Contemn: to treat or regard with disdain, scorn, or contempt. Chapter 3, Wolfe to Priscilla Eads: "I'm glad you contemn it as blackmail, since I like to pretend that I earn at least a fraction of what I collect...."
Juridical. Chapter 9.
Wroth: intensely angry, highly incensed. Chapter 15, Archie's description of Wolfe's tone: "He was gruff but not wroth."

Reviews and commentary
Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime â€” Archie is Nero's client, because he feels responsible for the death of a young woman who sought asylum at Nero's house. In the sequel two other women are strangled as the result of a stupid will and a claim on it foolishly certified. The case is complex, the parties are hostile (so are Nero and Archie) and for once the police behave reasonably and civilly. [2]
Anthony Boucher , The New York Times Book Review (November 9, 1952) â€” Pure detection (fleshed, of course, with humor and characterization) remains the trademark of Rex Stout. Prisoner's Base is a bit more conventional than last year's fine Murder by the Book , but still very solidly gratifying. Nero Wolfe refuses sanctuary to a potential client, thereby indirectly causing her death; the resultant investigation places Archie Goodwin in the doubly unheard-of position of being Nero's client himself and working closely with the New York Police Department. The solution is surprising, the construction tight; in this particular vein only Mr. Stout himself is apt to produce a better book.
The New Yorker (November 1, 1952) â€” An expert job, tailored to the last detail to the demands of Mr. Stout's admirers.
Saturday Review of Literature (November 1, 1952) â€” Archie Goodwin and cops work hard to bring this one off. Good.
