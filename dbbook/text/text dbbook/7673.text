A Time to Kill is a 1989 legal suspense thriller by John Grisham. It was Grisham's first novel. The novel was rejected by many publishers before Wynwood Press (located in New York) eventually gave it a modest 5,000-copy printing. After The Firm, The Pelican Brief, and The Client became bestsellers, interest in A Time to Kill grew; the book was republished by Doubleday in hardcover and, later, by Dell Publishing in paperback, and itself became a bestseller. This made Grisham extremely popular among readers. In 1996 the novel was adapted into a film of the same name, starring Matthew McConaughey and Samuel L. Jackson. In 2011 it was further adapted into stage play of the same name. The pre-Broadway production began previews at Arena Stage (Washington, D.C. ) on May 6, 2011, and opened May 22.
