One Step Behind is a crime novel by Swedish author Henning Mankell, the seventh in his acclaimed Inspector Wallander series.
Synopsis
Two young women and one young man, inexplicably dressed as the nobility of Sweden did during the reign of Gustavus III , are found dead, each slain with a single bullet, their bodies half consumed by animals in the wilderness. Wallander is horrified when he makes a connection between the crime and his close friend Svedberg, and after the latter is found savagely murdered in his own apartment, the tormented detective finds himself up against a deranged, merciless killer who remains just one step ahead of him.
Adaptation
In 2005, One Step Behind was adapted by Swedish public broadcaster Sveriges Television into a theatrical film, starring Rolf LassgÃ¥rd as Wallander. In 2008, British broadcaster BBC One broadcast a 90-minute adaptation as part of its Wallander television series starring Kenneth Branagh .
