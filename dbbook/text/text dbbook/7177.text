The Book
Previous readers of Noon will be in familiar territory, the book is set in the near future of Manchester 2002, and the drugs as music metaphor is the essence of the novel. Eschewing conventional punctuation , capitalisation and grammar , the book reads as if it is a series of song lyrics .
The book also traces the history of pop music in Manchester, starting with skiffle in 1957, running through the sixties, before coming to an angry explosion with the punk of 1977 and the Buzzcocks . This love for music is also expressed by the names of the streets. Poking fun at the increasing excesses taken towards marketing our heritage, Manchester streets have been renamed after Mancunian bands and musicians. So we are given Ian Curtis Boulevard, a street called Gerald , Bee Gees Avenue and even Northern Uproar cul-de-sac.
This was Noon's farewell book to Manchester, before he moved to Brighton , and, for the time being, seems to be the last set in the Vurt /Manchester universe. His next work, Falling Out of Cars is his first not to be set in that city.
