The Blood Confession is a 2006 historical fiction novel written by Alisa M. Libby. The novel is a revisionist telling of the legend of Countess Elizabeth Báthory, with elements of the fairy tale Snow White.
Plot
The book follows the character of Countess Erzebet, a young noblewoman held prisoner while being charged with murder. As the book unfolds, Erzebet tells her life's story, from her ill-omened birth to the crimes she's charged with.
Reception
The Blood Confession received a positive review from Strange Horizons , stating that while "first half of the book does wander... it is in its modern connotations that Libby's book really soars and disturbs". [2] Kirkus Reviews praised "Libbyâ€™s combination of history, fairy tales and the Bible" but stated that it was "a conceptually interesting but sluggishly paced gothic horror". [3] The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books wrote that the book was "not for the faint of heart" and that "this first person narrative doesnâ€™t leave out any of the gory details." [4] The School Library Journal praised the book's characterizations while stating that the book's "depiction of Erzebet's descent into madness is overly lengthy". [5]
