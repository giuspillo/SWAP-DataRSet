The Discworld Mapp is an atlas that contains a large, fold out map of the Discworld fictional world, drawn by Stephen Player to the directions of Terry Pratchett and Stephen Briggs. It also contains a short booklet relating the adventures and explorers of the Disc and their discoveries. It was originally conceived as the second in a series of three maps, along with The Streets of Ankh-Morpork and A Tourist Guide to Lancre. For this work, Briggs became known as the "cartographer of Discworld. " A fourth atlas. Death's Domain, was added to the series. After its publication, Pratchett was surprised to learn that British bookstores were displaying it in their nonfiction sections because, they argued, it was a real map, though of a fictional place.
