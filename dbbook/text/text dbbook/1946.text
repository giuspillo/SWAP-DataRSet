By Nightfall is the sixth novel by Pulitzer Prize winning American author, Michael Cunningham.
Plot
Peter and his wife, Rebeccaâ€”who edits a mid-level art magazineâ€”have settled into a comfortable life in Manhattan's art world, but their staid existence is disrupted by the arrival of Rebecca's much younger brother, Ethanâ€”known as Mizzy, short for "The Mistake." Family golden child Mizzy is a recovering drug addict whose current whim has landed him in New York where he wants to pursue a career in "the arts." Watching Mizzyâ€”whose resemblance to a younger Rebecca unnerves Peterâ€”coast through life without responsibilities makes Peter question his own choices and wonder if it's more than Mizzy's freedom that he covets.
