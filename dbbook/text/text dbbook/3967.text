Whistle for Willie is a 1964 children's picture book by American author and illustrator Ezra Jack Keats. In this sequel to The Snowy Day, an older and wiser Peter wants to learn to whistle in order to call his dog Willie. Peter tries so hard to whistle that his cheeks hurt, but he doesn’t give up. With a very light hand and his legendary illustrations, Keats creates a world in which effort yields results.
