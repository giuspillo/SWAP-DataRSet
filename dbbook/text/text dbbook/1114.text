Critical reception
The book is the first and only book written by H. F. Saint and is generally well received. Time magazine reviewed it as a "flat-out thriller, accurately described by its narrator-hero on the opening page as 'quite genuinely exciting and superficial'". [9] It is applauded by user reviews for its extreme detail in portraying the difficulties of invisibility which makes it unique among other books sharing an invisibility plot. [10] [11] An editorial review from Publishers Weekly describes the book's dialogue as "absolutely true and suspense sustained at high pitch throughout, this supple fantasy attends so cleverly to plausible elements that it entertains from beginning to end". [12] The book has been adapted in a film version for which H.F. Saint received a generous sum, in comparison to other films, of $2.5 million USD in motion picture (from Warner Bros. ) and book-club rights. [13] The film had less success than the book, gaining only 24% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 5.8/10 on IMDb . [14] [15] Although the final publication had good reviews, an early partial draft was rejected from another publisher. [13] Early on, H. F. Saint was devoted to becoming a full writer but later retired due to the book's success. [16]
