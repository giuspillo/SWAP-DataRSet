In 1951, a film adaptation of the play , directed by Elia Kazan , with Brando, Malden and Hunter reprising their stage roles, joined by Vivien Leigh for the part of Blanche. The movie won four Academy Awards , including three acting awards (Leigh for Best Actress , Malden for Best Supporting Actor and Hunter for Best Supporting Actress ), the first time a film won three out of four acting awards (Brando was nominated for Best Actor but lost). Jessica Tandy was the only lead actor from the original Broadway production not to appear the 1951 film. References to Allan Grey's sexual orientation are essentially removed, due to Motion Picture Production Code restrictions. Instead, the reason for his suicide is changed to a general "weakness". [17]
Pedro AlmodÃ³var 's 1999 Academy Award -winning film, All About My Mother , features a Spanish-language version of the play being performed by some of the supporting characters. However, some of the film's dialogue is taken from the 1951 film version, not the original stage version.
It was noted by many critics that the 2013 Woody Allen film, Blue Jasmine , had much in common with Streetcar and is most likely to be a loose adaptation. It shares a very similar plot and characters, although it has been suitably updated for modern film audiences. [18] [19]
Opera
In 1995, an opera was adapted and composed by AndrÃ© Previn with a libretto by Philip Littell. It had its premiere at the San Francisco Opera during the 1998â€“99 season, and featured RenÃ©e Fleming as Blanche.
Ballet
A 1952 ballet production, which was staged at Her Majesty's Theatre in Montreal , featured the music of Alex North , who had composed the music for the 1951 film.
Another ballet production was staged by John Neumeier in Frankfurt in 1983. Music included Visions fugitives by Prokofiev and Alfred Schnittke 's First Symphony .
In 2012, Scottish Ballet collaborated with theatre and film director Nancy Meckler and international choreographer Annabelle Lopez Ochoa to create a new staging of A Streetcar Named Desire. [20]

The real streetcar named Desire

The Desire Line ran from 1920 to 1948, at the height of streetcar use in New Orleans. The route ran down Bourbon, through the Quarter, to Desire Street in the Bywater district , and back up to Canal. Blanche's route in the playâ€”"They told me to take a streetcar named Desire, transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off atâ€”Elysian Fields!"â€”is allegorical, taking advantage of New Orleans colorful street names.
