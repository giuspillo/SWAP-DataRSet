The Murder on the Links is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first published in the UK by The Bodley Head in May 1923 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in the same year. It features Hercule Poirot and Arthur Hastings. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $1.75. The book is notable for a subplot in which Hastings meets his future wife, Dulcie Duveen, a development "greatly desired on Agatha's part … parcelling off Hastings to wedded bliss in the Argentine."
Plot summary
Captain Hastings has breakfast in the flat that he shares with Poirot in London. In the morning mail, Poirot finds an extraordinary letter: "For God's sake, come!" writes Monsieur Paul Renauld. Directly, Poirot and Hastings go to Renauld's home, the Villa Genevieve in Merlinville-sur-Mer on the north coast of France. Asking for directions near the villa, they are watched by a beautiful girl who has "anxious eyes". At the gates, they learn that Renaud has been murdered this morning; the police are present.
Renauld and his wife were attacked in their rooms at 2:00 am by two masked and bearded men. Madame Renauld was tied up and her husband taken away. Entry to the house was through the open front door. Renaud's body was found, stabbed in the back, in a newly-dug open grave on the edge of an adjacent golf course . The grave was in the area of a bunker which was due to be dug that day. Renauld had sent his son Jack away on business to South America; given the chauffeur a holiday, leaving only three female servants in the house; and his secretary, Gabriel Stoner, remains in England.
One servant tells Poirot and the police that the night before â€“ and often, in recent days â€“ after Madame Renauld had retired to bed for the night, her husband was visited by the neighbour, Madame Daubreuil, who is the mother of Marthe Daubreuil, the girl with the "anxious eyes". Another servant says it was an unknown woman who came the day before, whom Renauld urged to "leave now". There is a smashed watch at the scene, a long piece of lead pipe, a love letter signed by "Bella", the fragment of a check with the name "Duveen", and the murder weapon, a letter opener used as a dagger. One upper storey window could be accessed by a tree; Poirot considers the matter of footprints in the flower beds near the tree the most important of the clues. After telling her story, the widow inspects the body to identify it. She collapses with grief at the sight of her dead husband.
Poirot investigates in Renauld's name, while the French magistrate and police do their work. Monsieur Giraud of the SÃ»retÃ© is overtly hostile to Poirot. The Examining Magistrate, Monsieur Hautet, is not, however, and shares key information with Poirot. He tells Poirot that Renaud changed his will just two weeks before, leaving almost everything to his wife and nothing to his son, and that Mme Daubreuil has paid two hundred thousand francs into her bank account in recent weeks. The lady rejects the suggestion they were lovers. Her anxious daughter pursues Poirot to learn if anyone is named as a suspect in Renauld's murder. The mother's face is familiar to Poirot from news photos of a case long ago. Unexpectedly, Hastings encounters the young lady "Cinderella" at the golf course, the same woman he met once on a train to Calais. She asks to be shown the exciting crime scenes, then disappears as unexpectedly as she had arrived, taking the murder weapon with her.
Stoner returns, suggesting blackmail is more likely than an affair, as Renauld's past before his career in South America is a mystery. Jack Renauld returns home, his ship having been delayed. Jack admits to having had an argument with his father over who he wants to marry, but shows he is unaware of the change in the will. Marthe Daubreuil is the girl in question, considered unsuitable to both his parents.
Poirot goes to Paris to conduct research. While he is away, another body is found with the dagger in his heart. No one recognises the wellâ€“dressed man who, by his hands, could be a tramp. The man has been dead for forty-eight hours, since before Monsieur Renauld's murder. Back from Paris, Poirot examines the new corpse together with the doctor. The foam on the dead man's lips leads the doctor to realise that the man died of an epileptic fit , and was stabbed after death.
Renauld's murder is similar to a famous case 22 years earlier. Young Mme Beroldy was on trial for the death of her middle-aged husband. He was murdered by two masked men who broke into their house at night. Mme Beroldy had a young lover, Georges Conneau, who absconded from justice but wrote a letter to the police admitting to the crime; there were no masked men and he stabbed the husband. He confessed because he learned that Mme Beroldy did not love him, but planned to marry yet another man once widowed. Mme Beroldy managed a tearful performance in the witness box, convincing the jury of her innocence. She and her young daughter left Paris.
Giraud concludes that Jack Renauld murdered his father, seeking to claim his inheritance without delay, and arrests him. Poirot notes two flaws in Giraud's theory: there was no advantage to Jack in murdering his father unless his father's body was discovered promptly; and the presence of the piece of lead pipe near the corpse remains unexplained.
Poirot deduces that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau. He fled France to Canada, gaining a wife and a son, then making his fortune in South America. When the family later settle in France, by great misfortune their immediate neighbour is Mme Beroldy, now Mme Daubreuil, who blackmails him. Worse, his son falls in love with her daughter. When a tramp dies on his grounds of an epileptic fit, Renauld sees a chance to repeat the ruse of years earlier, but with one change. He will fake his own death to escape his blackmailer. He first sends away those who could recognise him, then stages his kidnapping by tying his wife up and disappearing. The tramp's body, disfigured by the lead pipe, will be buried, and Renauld will leave on the last train. The plan was foiled when Renauld was stabbed by someone else after he finished digging the grave but before he could fetch the tramp's body. Thus his wife, when shown the first dead body, was truly shocked to discover it was her husband's after all.
Jack is released from prison when Bella Duveen confesses to the murder, falsely. Jack tells Poirot how the two arrived by chance simultaneously at the site of his father's death. Poirot realises that leaves only one with a motive: Marthe Daubreuil. She overheard the Renaulds discussing the ruse, and she stabbed Renauld on the golf course after he had dug the grave. Poirot asks Mme Renauld to openly disinherit Jack, so he will leave his mother alone in the house and give Marthe a motive to kill her. Marthe dies trying to kill Mme Renauld, who is saved by Cinderella. Marthe's mother disappears again. Jack and his mother plan to go to South America, joined by Hastings and Dulcie Duveen, who is his Cinderella and Bella's twin sister.

Literary significance and reception
The Times Literary Supplement reviewed the novel in its issue of 7 June 1923. The review compared the methods of detection of Poirot to Sherlock Holmes and concluded favourably that the book "provides the reader with an enthralling mystery of an unusual kind". [5]
The New York Times Book Review of 25 March 1923 began, "Here is a remarkably good detective story which can be warmly commended to those who like that kind of fiction." After detailing the set-up of the story the review continued, "The plot has peculiar complications and the reader will have to be very astute indeed if he guesses who the criminal is until the last complexity has been unravelled. The author is notably ingenious in the construction and unravelling of the mystery, which develops fresh interests and new entanglements at every turn. She deserves commendation also for the care with which the story is worked out and the good craftsmanship with which it is written. Although there is not much endeavour to portray character, except in the case of M. Poirot, several of the personages are depicted with swiftly made expressive and distinctive lines." [6]
The unnamed reviewer in The Observer of 10 June 1923 said, "When Conan Doyle popularised Sherlock Holmes in the Strand of the 'nineties he lit such a candle as the publishers will not willingly let out. Not a week passes which does not bring a 'detective' story from one quarter or another, and several of the popular magazines rely mainly on that commodity. Among the later cultivators of this anything but lonely furrow the name of Agatha Christie is well in the front. If she has not the touch of artistry which made The Speckled Band and The Hound of the Baskervilles things of real horror, she has an unusual gift of mechanical complication." The reviewer went on to compare the novel with The Mysterious Affair at Styles which they called, "a remarkable piece of work" but warned that, "it is a mistake to carry the art of bewilderment to the point of making the brain reel." They did admit that, "No solution could be more surprising" and stated that the character of Poirot was, "a pleasant contrast to most of his lurid competitors; and one even suspects a touch of satire in him." [7]
Robert Barnard : "Super-complicated early whodunit, set in the northerly fringes of France so beloved of the English bankrupt. Poirot pits his wits against a sneering sophisticate of a French policeman while Hastings lets his wander after an auburn-haired female acrobat. Entertaining for most of its length, but the solution is one of those 'once revealed, instantly forgotten' ones, where ingenuity has triumphed over common sense". [8]
Some additional blurbs regarding the book, and used by The Bodley Head for advertising subsequent print runs, include:
"One of the best mystery stories I have read." â€“ S.P.B. Mais in The Daily Express . [9]
"A clinking yarn, most ingeniously contrived and skilfully evolved â€¦ there is not a superfluous word or a dull one from start to finishâ€¦ the very best of this sort of fiction." â€“ Winnifred Blatchford in The Clarion . [9]
"A thrilling and accomplished book." â€“ Observer . [9]
"Mrs Christie has a surprising gift of keeping the reader's tension unslacked, of heaping excitement on excitement, and of always having a surprise up her sleeve." â€“ Daily Mail . [9]
"Unhesitatingly we recommend 'The Murder on the Links' to every lover of such tales, and every non-lover likewise we advise to read it and thereupon reconsider their previous opinion." â€“ Queen . [9]
"A godsend to hardened readers of fiction." â€“ Illustrated London News . [9]
"A very convincing and most readable book." â€“ Challenge. [9]
"A really good detective story." â€“ Tatler . [9]
"A capital story, cleverly designed, briskly told." â€“ Bookman . [9]
"None can say that Mrs Christie is lacking either in imagination or the ability to tell a good story." â€“ Daily Graphic . [9]
"A rattling, ingenious mystery yarn." â€“ London Opinion . [9]
In a modern work of literary criticism, Christie biographer Laura Thompson writes:
Murder on the Links was as different from its predecessor as that had been from Styles. It is very French; not just in setting but in tone, which reeks of Gaston Leroux and, at times, Racine â€¦ Agatha admitted that she had written it in a "high-flown, fanciful" manner. She had also based the book too closely upon a real-life French murder case, which gives the story a kind of non-artistic complexity.
â€¦
But Poirot is magnificently himself. What originality there is in Murder on the Links comes straight from his thought processes. For example he deduces the modus operandi of the crime because it is a repeat, essentially, of an earlier murder; this proves his favourite theory that human nature does not change, even when the human in question is a killer: " The English murderer who disposed of his wives in succession by drowning them in their baths was a case in point. Had he varied his methods, he might have escaped detection to this day. But he obeyed the common dictates of human nature, arguing that what had once succeeded would succeed again, and he paid the penalty of his lack of originality." [4]
