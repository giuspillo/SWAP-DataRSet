Plot
Joss, a middle-aged former Breton sailor, begins to succeed in reviving the old family trade of town crier in modern-day Paris. Business is good, since people gladly pay five francs to hear their rants and nonsensical messages in parks and squares; every so often, ominous cryptic messages announcing the return of the plague will also be part of the dayâ€™s requested cries.
At the same time, chief inspector Adamsberg is surprised as a distressed woman describes that all her apartment buildingâ€™s doors, except one, have been marked with a large inverted â€œ4â€� in black ink with the inscription â€œCLT.â€� This graffiti continues to turn up throughout the city, and residents of apartments with unmarked doors are turning up dead, showing signs of rat-flea bites and blackened flesh.
