The Spirit of the Liturgy ( German : Der Geist der Liturgie) is a 2000 book written by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger ( Pope Benedict XVI ) before his ascension to the papacy.
Excerpts
â€œThe Altar and the Direction of Liturgical Prayer:
The re-shaping so far described, of the Jewish synagogue for the purpose of Christian worship, clearly shows--as we have already said--how, even in architecture, there is both continuity and newness in the relationship of the Old Testament to the New.â€�
â€œMusic and Liturgy:
The importance of music in biblical religion is shown very simply by the fact that the verb "to sing" (with related words such as "song", and so forth) is one of the most commonly used words in the Bible.â€� [1]
