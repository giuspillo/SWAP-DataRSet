How to Lose Friends & Alienate People (2001) is a memoir by Toby Young about his failed five-year effort to make it in the U.S. as a contributing editor at Condé Nast Publications' Vanity Fair magazine. He has written a sequel called The Sound of No Hands Clapping which chronicles his failure as a Hollywood screenwriter in the years after he left New York. A feature-length film, titled How to Lose Friends & Alienate People was released in October 2008. It is directed by Robert B. Weide and stars Simon Pegg, Kirsten Dunst, and Megan Fox. The film is loosely based on the book, and gives a more glamorous view on Young's misadventures while at Conde Nast, leaving out Young's philosophical ramblings. The title of Young's book is a parody of the title of Dale Carnegie's 1937 perennial bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People; a parody by Irving Tressler titled How to Lose Friends and Alienate People was also published that same year. Young's book does not reference either Carnegie's or Tressler's works.
