The Most Beautiful Woman in Town & Other Stories is a collection of anecdotal short stories by American author Charles Bukowski. The stories are written in both the first and third-person, in Bukowski's trademark semi-autobiographical short prose style. In keeping with his other works, themes include: Los Angeles bar culture; alcoholism; gambling; sex and violence. However, many of the stories contain elements of fantasy and surrealism. The book was initially printed as Erections, ejaculations, exhibitions and general tales of ordinary madness. The stories originally appeared in Open City, Nola Express, Knight, Adam, Adam Reader, Pix, The Berkeley Barb and Evergreen Review.
