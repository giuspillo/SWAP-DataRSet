The Syndic is a 1953 science fiction novel by Cyril M. Kornbluth.
Plot summary
The prologue introduces the setting, a future North America divided between rival criminal gangs the Syndic on the East Coast and the Mob in Las Vegas , who have driven the federal government into exile in Iceland . Life has more or less returned to normal in Syndic territory â€“ as long as protection money is paid on time.
The protagonist, Charles Orsino is a low-ranking member of the Syndic who collects protection money in New York . After a failed assassination attempt he is invited to a meeting of the leaders of the Syndic, who suspect that the exiled government were responsible. To discover the truth, Charles volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate both the government and the Mob.
Reception and influences
The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction noted that the novel had wrongly been seen as "deficient" in comparison with Kornbluth's collaborative work, concluding that aspects of the Syndic government structure were "effective and even prophetic." [1]
The novel's exploration of anarcho-capitalism proved popular with libertarians . The novel had an influence on Samuel Edward Konkin III , who considered it an under appreciated classic. [2] It was also inducted into the Prometheus Award Hall of Fame in 1986. [3]
