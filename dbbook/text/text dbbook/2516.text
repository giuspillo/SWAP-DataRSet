Setsuna, Kuchinashi, Mio call a surrender and release Eve. When Blade goes to see Eve, she attacks him out of nowhere, drilling a hole in his chest. This is because Kurumi , a fourth member of the squadron, used her ability to control the mind, manipulating Eve's thoughts and actions. While Disc performs emergency medical procedures on Blade, Gido believes that if the group can get Eve back to normal, then it would allow her to switch places with Blade and heal his body.

They send the baseball into the bookshelf where Kurumi was hiding, stabbing her on impact. Cruz explains his reasoning of how he knew where Kurumi was hiding, pointing out that she would only be behind a large book placed on the second shelf based on the layout of the room. After Kurumi falls to her death, Eve seems to return back to normal. However, this is not true since she is still brainwashed, aside from the fact that Kurumi died. After Teruyama, Set, and Solva incur severe injuries from Eve's surprise attack, Disc tells Cruz and Gido that there could still be a way to return Eve back to normal.

As Disc continues to recover Blade, Gido act as decoy against the Simeon Girl Squadron, while Cruz sneaks past them to get to Kurumi's body. Saten , another of the four elite from the Simeon Tower, suddenly appears and instills fear on everyone.

Saten freezes Kurumi's body and tells the Simeon Girl Squadron to take her away, before beginning his fight with Blade and covering the floor with ice. He uses his ability to absorb thermal energy and redirect it in various ways, such as fire, ice, and wind. Blade uses the Byakugou to learn this ability, but it fails to work.

She is actually a spy from the Simeon Tower, sent to leak top-secret information about the Resistance. There is a data chip inside Cruz's pendant containing that information, as she was ordered to retrieve the data chip to Arclight. In order to protect Cruz from harm, Set and Solva attack Aruka, but they are no match against her since she has already figured out their abilities. Even Teruyama's immunity to heat has no effect against Aruka's ability. Aruka then severely injures Cruz, but as she attempts to kill him, Blade stands in her way.

When the Resistance tries to ambush Arclight on his way to the Simeon Tower, the four elite ones kill off much of the Resistance. Aruka is soon unveiled to be an informant for Arclight, much to Zakard's surprise. Zakard uses his ability to make an armor of regenerative rock formed around him, as he begins to battle Arclight. However, Arclight easily defeats Zakard with a series of learned abilities, and Arclight then crushes Zakard after the latter says that the data chip is not longer in his possession. Meanwhile, Cruz and Aruka were being chased by a Testament. When Cruz was hiding in the sewer, Aruka actually destroyed the Testament and made it out alive.

The laboratory is breached by an unknown intruder, who takes out the engineers and guards. When the intruder, revealed as a derailed Arclight, approaches Eve, Blade blocks him and fights back. Arclight then enters into a restricted area in the underground plant which contains remnants of the "Second", fusing with it to absorb its incredible power.

Saten claims himself as the new leader of the Simeon Tower. He wants to claim Eve as the bearer of his future children, so he forcefully takes her into his arms and knocks her unconscious. It is implied that there are traces of Kazumi inside Eve after the lab accident. Teruyama, Set, and Solva combine their abilities for a grand attack, but Saten overpowers them with that of his own. Not even Setsuna, Kuchinashi, and Mio can stop him with their abilities. After Riru mourns for Arclight and reminisces of her life spent with him, she uses her body as a sacrifice to revive him. Blade attempts to use his Byakugou on Saten, but latter starts to dig into the former's chest. Arclight, first appearing as Riru, subdues Saten and shows that his heart and right eye are completely healed. Arclight then uses his Byakugou on Saten, but this does not start a reverse rejection reaction. Instead, by using the field generators around the tower, this consumes all of Saten's learned abilities while it erases his very existence at the same time. Before he vanishes, he returns Eve to Gido, who cries out for him.
