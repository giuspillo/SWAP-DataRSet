Mike Russell founded American City Business Journals. The President and CEO of American City is Whitney Shaw. Shaw was previously senior vice president of ACBJ and president of its sports-publishing division. He succeeds his father, Ray Shaw, who was chairman and CEO of ACBJ for 25 years. Ray Shaw , the company's chairman from 1989 until his 2009 death, bought a controlling interest along with a partner in 1989, selling to Advance Publications in 1995. It was Russell who suggested Shaw buy the entire company rather than just a few journals. Under Ray Shaw's leadership, the company moved from Kansas City, Missouri , to Charlotte, North Carolina, and greatly increased the number of its publications. [3]
