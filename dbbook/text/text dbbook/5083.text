Plot introduction
The novel takes place in 1966. However, it occurs in a world with an alternative history . The Plantagenet kings survived and rule a large Anglo-French Empire. In addition, around AD 1300 the laws of magic were discovered and magical science developed. The physical sciences were never pursued. The society looks early Victorian , though medical magic is superior to our medicine.
The book uses the conventions of a detective story . The protagonist is Lord Darcy, Chief Investigator for the Duke of Normandy . This Sherlock Holmes -like figure is assisted by Master Sean Oâ€™Lochlainn, a forensic sorcerer.
The novel is a locked room mystery , which takes place at a wizards â€™ convention . Garrett delights in puns. Analogues of Nero Wolfe , Archie Goodwin , James Bond and Gandalf the Grey appear.
Lord Darcy also appears in several other novellas and short stories by Garrett, but this is Garrett's only novel-length Lord Darcy story. Michael Kurland has written two further novels set in the Lord Darcy universe.
