Rabbit, Run is a 1960 novel by John Updike. The novel depicts five months in the life of a 26-year-old former high school basketball player named Harry 'Rabbit' Angstrom, and his attempts to escape the constraints of his life. It spawned several sequels, including Rabbit Redux, Rabbit is Rich and Rabbit at Rest, as well as a related 2001 novella, Rabbit Remembered.

Rabbit and Angstrom
A rabbit is "a person likened to a rabbit, typically in being timid or ineffectual; a poor or novice player" [3] and "a runner who intentionally sets a fast pace for a teammate during a long-distance race." [4]
Besides its other associations, Updike may have chosen the name Rabbit for his character for its echo of Sinclair Lewis 's Babbitt , whose main theme "focuses on the power of conformity, and the vacuity of middle-class American life." This is unlikely, however, as Updike claims not to have read Lewis's novel until after he wrote Rabbit at Rest . [5]
Updike said in interviews that the name Angstrom was inspired by his reading of Kierkegaard and meant to suggest 'stream of Angst '.
References to other works
Previously, Updike had written a short story entitled Ace In The Hole, and to a lesser extent a poem, Ex-Basketball Player, with similar themes to Rabbit Run. [6]
John Updike said that he wrote Rabbit, Run in response to Jack Kerouac 's On the Road , and tried to depict "what happens when a young American family man goes on the road â€“ the people left behind get hurt." [6]
The screenplay for 8 Mile by Scott Silver opens with a quote from Rabbit, Run: "If you have the guts to be yourself...other people'll pay your price," and the main character is nicknamed "Rabbit." [7]
The last song on the 8 Mile OST is called Rabbit Run, a song about writer's block from the perspective of rap artist Eminem.
The philosopher Daniel Dennett makes extended reference to the Rabbit novels in his paper "The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity". [8]
Literary significance
The text of the novel went through several rewrites. Knopf originally required Updike to cut some "sexually explicit passages," but he restored and rewrote the book for the 1963 Penguin edition and again for the 1995 Everyman's omnibus edition. [9]
Though it had been done earlier, as in Faulkner's As I Lay Dying and Camus' The Fall , Updike's novel is noted as being one of several well regarded, early usages of the present tense. Updike stated:
â€œ
In Rabbit, Run, I liked writing in the present tense. You can move between minds, between thoughts and objects and events with a curious ease not available to the past tense. I don't know if it is clear to the reader as it is to the person writing, but there are kinds of poetry, kinds of music you can strike off in the present tense. [10]

Time magazine included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005. [11]
Film adaptation
In 1970, the novel was made into a film directed by Jack Smight and starring James Caan as Rabbit, Carrie Snodgress as Janice and Jack Albertson as Marty. The script was co-written by Updike and Howard B. Kreitsek . [12] [13] The poster reads, "3 months ago Rabbit Angstrom ran out to buy his wife cigarettes. He hasn't come home yet." [14]
