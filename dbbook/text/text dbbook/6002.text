Nothing But Blue Skies is a humorous fantasy novel by English author Tom Holt. It was first published in the UK by Orbit Books in 2001.
Plot introduction
The plot of the book concerns a Chinese Dragon , Karen, who falls in love with a mortal, Paul, and so decides to become mortal herself in the hope that they get together. However, she is not any ordinary dragon; she is the daughter of the adjutant-general to the Dragon King of the North West. Naturally her father is worried and comes to look for her, but he falls foul of the Weathermen , who consider dragons their sworn enemies. The Weathermen though fall foul of a government plot to cause a drought in Britain as a pretext for invading Australia. Actually, this is also a cover for the real reason. Paul is really the runaway son of an Australian global media tycoon, who wants to lure the dragons to his outback hideaway. Here he uses a machine to disarm their abilities in order to use their 'third eye' as a super-efficient mode of multimedia communication.
Major themes
This book has its origins in many mythologies and Tom Holt weaves these into a classic love tangle and conspiracy theory with the easy and dry wit of his other humorous novels. He displays a fondness for biting similes reminiscent of Douglas Adams .
Critic Review
This was considered a return to form for the author and that it would "guarantee to cheer up a rainy day". [1]
