In Patagonia is an English travel book by Bruce Chatwin, published in 1977.
Preparations
In 1972, Chatwin was hired by the Sunday Times Magazine as an adviser on art and architecture. [1] His association with the magazine cultivated his narrative skills and he travelled on many international assignments, writing on such subjects as Algerian migrant workers and the Great Wall of China , and interviewing such people as AndrÃ© Malraux , [2] in France, and Nadezhda Mandelstam , [3] in the Soviet Union .
In 1972, Chatwin interviewed the 93-year-old architect and designer Eileen Gray in her Paris salon, where he noticed a map of the area of South America called Patagonia which she had painted. [4] "I've always wanted to go there," Bruce told her. "So have I," she replied, "go there for me." Two years later, in November 1974, Chatwin flew out to Lima in Peru , and reached Patagonia a month later. [5] When he arrived there he severed himself from the newspaper with a telegram : "Have gone to Patagonia." He spent six months there, a trip which resulted in the book In Patagonia (1977), which established his reputation as a travel writer.
Critics
"With this book," a reviewer noted, "Chatwin redefined the genre of travel writing with his little nuggets of historical information weaved intricately together with his search for anecdotes." [6] The New York Times described it as a "little masterpiece of travel, history, and adventure." [7] Chatwin's fascination with Patagonia had its roots in a scrap of mylodon skin that sailor Charley Milward, his grandmother's cousin, had sent back to England. [8]
After Chatwin had published the book and gained acclaim as a travel writer, however, residents in the region came forward to contradict the events depicted in the book. [9] It was the first, but not the last, time in his career that conversations and characters that Chatwin reported were alleged to have been fictionalised.[ citation needed ]
