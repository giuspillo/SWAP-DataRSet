Unlike his other books, Half Asleep is written entirely in the second person, present tense. Robbins was a personal friend of Terence McKenna, whose influence is evident in several of his books. A main character in Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas named Larry Diamond advocates a theory similar to those of McKenna, involving psilocybin.
