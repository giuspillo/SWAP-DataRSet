Digging to America, published by Knopf in May 2006, is American author Anne Tyler's seventeenth novel.
Plot
Digging to America is a story set in Baltimore, Maryland about two very different familiesâ€™ experiences with adoption and their relationships with each other. Sami and Ziba Yazdan, an Iranian-American family, and Brad and Bitsy Dickinson-Donaldson, an all-American suburban family, meet at the airport on the day their infant daughters arrive from Korea to begin life in America . The two families become friends and begin a tradition of celebrating the arrival of their adopted daughters each year.
The differences between the two families are apparent from the beginning, especially in the way each couple decides to raise their daughters. Brad and Bitsy choose not to Americanize their daughter, Jin-Ho; they keep her Korean name and teach her about Korean culture as she grows up. Sami and Ziba, on the other hand, choose to raise their daughter Susan like other American children.
Through the efforts of Bitsy, the two families begin a tradition of celebrating their daughtersâ€™ arrival in America with an Arrival Party each year. The celebration becomes a mix of American , Korean , and Iranian culture with the different food and people present. The story continues to progress through the early childhood of Jin-Ho and Susan, displaying the differences in how they are raised and the impact it has on them as they grow older. At times, the relationship between the two families is strained because of their contrasting opinions of some issues, but they remain good friends throughout the entire story.
As the lives of the two families continue to become closer, a new and separate relationship starts to flourish between Bitsyâ€™s widowed father, Dave, and Samiâ€™s widowed mother, Maryam. Dave has recently lost his wife to cancer and is in need of a companion to help him recover from the loss. Maryam, who has been widowed for many years, is at first reluctant to change her life of privacy for Dave, but she eventually gives in. In the end, Maryam realizes that Dave is too much of a threat to the orderly boundaries of her life, and she ends their relationship.

Belonging
One of the themes in Tylerâ€™s novel is the struggle to belong in America. Both the Donaldsons and the Yazdans adopt daughters from Korea ; however, they take very different approaches to raising them. The Yazdans do more to make Susan feel like she is American than the Donaldsons do for Jin-Ho. The Yazdans change Sookiâ€™s name to Susan, allow her to wear jeans, and style her hair in an American way. The Donaldsons keep Jin-Hoâ€™s name the same, often dress her in Korean clothes and keep her hair the same as when she first arrived in America.
Maryam struggles with the feeling that she doesnâ€™t belong in America even though sheâ€™s been there for many years. She moved to America as a teenager and is now a U.S. citizen , but she is reluctant to call herself an American. She has distanced herself from the fast-paced American lifestyle. She does not own an answering machine or a cell phone. She says she danced the usual â€œImmigration Tangoâ€�, she was happy to become a U.S. citizen but sad to no longer be an Iranian citizen.
Parenting
Another theme in this novel is parenting. Bitsy and Ziba have very different parenting techniques, which often creates tension between them. Bitsy and Brad choose to maintain much about what makes Jin-Ho Korean, and, while Sami and Ziba do not forget this piece of who Susan is, they do not focus on it as much. Bitsy is often very critical of the way Ziba is raising Susan. She does not agree with Zibaâ€™s decision to work a few days a week, leaving Susan with Maryam. When Ziba announces that Susan is attending preschool , Bitsy says that Susan is too young. Bitsy is also critical when the Yazdans give Jin-Ho soda and it makes her sick. While at first Ziba appreciates these critiques and finds everything Bitsy knows about parenting impressive, she soon tires of it. When Brad and Bitsy adopt their second child Xiu-Mei, Bitsyâ€™s strict parenting style diminishes and she is no longer as critical of the way Ziba raises Susan.
Public/Private Boundaries
Another theme in the novel is the boundary between what parts of family life are shared and what parts should be kept private. The Yazdans keep more of their family life private than the Donaldsons do. From the very beginning of the book, the differences are clear. The Yazdans have a very small group of people to greet the baby at the airport, while the Donaldsons invite all of their extended family . Some things that most families would do in the privacy of their homes become a public affair for the Donaldons. Toilet training Jin-Ho, for example, is something most would keep private, but Bitsy actually throws a party to celebrate the event. When Dave proposes to Maryam, he does so in front of both of their families. He feels this is appropriate, but Maryam is horrified by the public proposal.
