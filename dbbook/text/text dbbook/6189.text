Two Years Before the Mast is a book by the American author Richard Henry Dana, Jr. , published in 1840, having been written after a two-year sea voyage starting in 1834. A film adaptation under the same name was released in 1946.
Dana arrived in Alta California when it was a remote province of independent Mexico , and no longer Spanish colonial Las Californias . He gives descriptions of landing at each of the ports up and down the California coast as they existed then. The ports served (south to north) the Mission San Diego de AlcalÃ¡ , Mission San Juan Capistrano , Pueblo de Los Angeles (and Mission San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel ), Mission Santa Barbara (and Presidio of Santa Barbara ), Presidio of Monterey , and Presidio of San Francisco with their very small settlements and surrounding large Mexican land grant Ranchos . He also describes the coastal Indigenous peoples , the Mexican Californios ' culture, and the immigrants and traders influences from other locales.
The headland bluffs near Mission San Juan Capistrano presented an obstacle to taking the cow hides to the beach for subsequent loading onto the ship. So Dana, along with others of the Pilgrim's crew, tossed the hides from the bluffs, while spinning them like a frisbee. Some hides got stuck part way down the cliff and Dana was lowered with ropes to retrieve them. The headlands, along with the adjacent present day city, took on Dana's name as Dana Point .
Being an intelligent and educated person, he learned Spanish from the Californian Mexicans and became an interpreter for his ship. He befriended Kanakan (native people of the Sandwich Islandsâ€” Hawaiian Islands ) sailors in the ports, one of whose life Dana would save when his captain would as soon see him die. He spent a season on the San Diego shore preparing hides for shipment to Boston, and his journey home. Dana also makes a tellingly accurate prediction of San Francisco 's future growth and significance.
Homebound
Of the return trip around Cape Horn, on his new ship the Alert, in the middle of the Antarctic winter, Dana gives the classic account. He describes terrifying storms and incredible beauty, giving vivid descriptions of icebergs , which he calls incomparable. The most incredible part perhaps is the weeks and weeks it took to negotiate passage against winds and stormsâ€”all the while having to race up and down the ice-covered rigging to furl and unfurl sails. At one point he has an infected tooth, and his face swells up so that he is unable to work for several days, despite the need for all hands. After the Horn has been rounded he describes the scurvy that afflicts members of the crew. In White-Jacket , Herman Melville wrote, "But if you want the best idea of Cape Horn, get my friend Dana's unmatchable Two Years Before the Mast. But you can read, and so you must have read it. His chapters describing Cape Horn must have been written with an icicle." [2]
Afterwards
First edition of Two Years Before the Mast, 1840
In 1869, Dana published a new edition which removed some content from the original and added an appendix entitled "Twenty-Four Years After". This appendix recounts his visit to California in 1859, after the Gold Rush , by which time the state had been totally transformed. During this trip, he revisited some of the sites mentioned in the book as well as seeing old friends, including some that had been mentioned in the book, and others he did not like, such as the company agent he had worked with, Alfred Robinson , who by this time was himself an author of a book on California. Dana expressed gratitude to Robinson for being polite to him, despite Dana not being kind to him in his book. He visited the Fremont mining operations in Mariposa County . Along with Jessie Fremont and her party, he went to Yosemite Valley . Stopping along the way at Clark's Station in Wawona , he described Galen Clark as a gracious host.
A final note records the fate of his ship, the Alert. In 1862 during the Civil War , it was captured by the Confederate commerce raider Alabama , the crew were forced into the boats, and the ship was destroyed.
Publication history

Dana's father first approached Harper and Brothers as they were his publishers, though the Danas rejected the original offer for 10 percent in royalties after the first 1,000 sold. [3] The manuscript, originally titled Journal, was rejected by four publishing houses after that offer from Harpers in 1839. Two Years Before the Mast was finally published in September 1840 in two versions, [4] without credit to Dana on the title page. [5] Dana had asked for assistance from the poet William Cullen Bryant , whose poem " Thanatopsis " was praised by Dana's father. Bryant again brought the manuscript to Harper's, hoping they would pay $500 to its author, though they ultimately paid Dana only $250 along with 24 complimentary copies. [6] Though the book sold 10,000 copies during its first year, Dana did not receive any royalties from sales of this edition of the book. [3]
In 1911, Dana's son, Richard Henry Dana III, added an introduction detailing the "subsequent story and fate of the vessels, and of some of the persons with whom the reader is made acquainted."
Two Years Before the Mast as literature
Two Years Before the Mast was "conceived as a protest and written to improve the lot of the common sailor". [7] The literary style provides a concrete description of a seamanâ€™s life to serve as a practical guide, and not as an adventure novel. [8] His unpolished, laconic style achieved a literary quality, however, that influenced novelist Herman Melville , according to American essayist Wright Morris . [9] In the following excerpt from Danaâ€™s diary, the entry expresses not only chronological information, but how a seaman â€œapprehends timeâ€�. [10]
Monday, Nov. 10th. During a part of this day we were hove to, but the rest of the time were driving on, under close-reefed sails, with a heavy sea, a strong gale, and frequent squalls of hail and snow.
Tuesday, Nov. 11th. The same.
Wednesday. The same.
Thursday. The same.
This next passage, describing Dana's first sighting of an iceberg off Cape Horn , â€œreminds us of Melvilleâ€� and â€œother passages seem to anticipate himâ€�. (Melville, born in 1819, was exactly four years Danaâ€™s junior, and returned from his first tour as a seaman when Two Years Before the Mast was first published in 1840).: [11]
â€¦And there lay, floating in the ocean, several miles off, an immense, irregular mass, its top and points covered with snow, and its centre of a deep indigo colorâ€¦. As far as the eye could reach, the sea in every direction was of a deep blue color, the waves running high and fresh, and sparkling in the light, and in the midst lay this immense mountain-island, its cavities and valleys thrown into deep shade, and its points and pinnacles glittering in the sunâ€¦.But no description can give any idea of the strangeness, splendor, and, really, the sublimity, of the sight. Its great sizeâ€¦ its slow motion, as its base rose and sank in the water, and its high points nodded against the clouds; the dashing of the waves upon it, which, breaking high with foam, lined its base with a white crust; and the thundering sound of the cracking of the mass, and the breaking and tumbling down of huge pieces; together with its nearness and approach, which added a slight element of fear,-- all combined to give to it the character of true sublimity.
The following description of the English sailor, Bill Jackson, has literary similarities to Melvilleâ€™s Billy Budd [12]
â€¦He was tall; but you only perceived it when he was standing by the side of others, for the great breadth of his shoulders and chest made him appear but little above the middle height. His chest was as deep as it was wide; his arm like that of Hercules; and his hand â€œthe fist of a tar â€“every hair a rope-yarn.â€� With all this he had one of the pleasantest smiles I ever saw. His cheeks were of a handsome brown; his teeth brilliantly white; and his hair, of a raven black, waved in loose curls all over his head, and fine, open forehead; and his eyes he might have sold to a duchess at the price of diamonds, for their brilliancyâ€¦Take him with his well-varnished black tarpaulin stuck upon the back of his head; his long locks coming down almost into his eyes; his white duck trousers and shirt; blue jacket; and black kerchief, tied loosely round his neck; and he was a fine specimen of manly beautyâ€¦ His strength must have been great, and he had the sight of a vulture. It is strange that one should be so minute in the description of an unknown, outcast sailor, whom one may never see again, and whom no one may care to hear about; but so it is. Some people we see under no remarkable circumstances, but whom, for some reason or other, we never forget. He called himself Bill Jacksonâ€¦
Writes Morris, "Dana is something more of a poet than either he or his contemporaries were aware; and that his ignorance of this gift was a loss to him as well as to us." [13]
Legacy
With the onset of the 1849 California Gold Rush , Dana's book was one of the few books in existence that described California, adding greatly to the book's readership as well as Dana's renown and legacy. When he returned to San Francisco in 1859 he was treated as a minor celebrity. To this day the book is regarded as a valuable historical resource describing 1830s California.
The geographic headland he wrote of, and the adjacent city, are named Dana Point for him.
There are schools named for him in Southern California , including:
Richard Henry Dana Elementary School in Dana Point (R.H. Dana )
