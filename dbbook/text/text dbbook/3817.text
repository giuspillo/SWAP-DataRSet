Demons by Daylight is a collection of stories by author Ramsey Campbell. Released in 1973, it was the author's second short-story collection, after The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants. Like the earlier book, it was published by Arkham House. It was published in an edition totaling 3,472 copies and with dust jacket art by Eddie Jones, commissioned by Campbell. A variant edition was published by Jove/HBJ in May 1979. In the section 'Rrelationships', this edition omits "The Second Staircase" and adds "Reply Guaranteed" and "The Telephones". The 1990 Carroll & Graf paperback reproduces the contents of the original Arkham House edition.
Critical response
Campbell has acknowledged that the stories in the book were written primarily under the stylistic influence of Vladimir Nabokov . Campbell was attempting to move away from his dependence on the influence of H.P. Lovecraft , and the style of these stories is radically different from the Cthulhu Mythos tales found in his first collection.
The book's first appearance induced T. E. D. Klein to write an extensive and highly positive review, "Ramsey Campbell: An Appreciation" in Nyctalops magazine and critic S. T. Joshi has stated [1] that:
its ... allusiveness of narration; careful, at times even obsessive focusing on the fleeting sensations and psychological processes of characters; an aggressively modern setting that allows commentary on social, cultural and political issues - all conjoin to make Demons by Daylight perhaps the most important book of horror fiction since Lovecraft 's The Outsider and Others .
Demons by Daylight contains the following stories, grouped into three sections:
Nightmares
"The End of a Summer's Day"
"At First Sight"
