Winesburg, Ohio is a 1919 short story cycle by the American author Sherwood Anderson. The work is structured around the life of protagonist George Willard, from the time he was a child to his growing independence and ultimate abandonment of Winesburg as a young man. It is set in the fictional town of Winesburg, Ohio (not to be confused with the actual Winesburg), which is based loosely on the author's childhood memories of Clyde, Ohio. Mostly written from late 1915 to early 1916, with a few stories completed closer to publication, they were "... conceived as complementary parts of a whole, centered in the background of a single community. " The book consists of twenty-two stories, with the first story, "The Book of the Grotesque", serving as an introduction. Each of the stories shares a specific character's past and present struggle to overcome the loneliness and isolation that seems to permeate the town. Stylistically, because of its emphasis on the psychological insights of characters over plot, and plain-spoken prose, Winesburg, Ohio is known as one of the earliest works of Modernist literature. Winesburg, Ohio was received well by critics despite some reservations about its moral tone and unconventional storytelling. Though its reputation waned in the 1930s, it has since rebounded and is now considered one of the most influential portraits of pre-industrial small-town life in the United States. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Winesburg, Ohio 24th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.
Little Review
December 1918
Though the stories were published to some acclaim in literary circles, [46] John Lane , the publisher of Anderson's first two novels, referred to the Winesburg, Ohio stories as "too gloomy" [47] and refused to publish them. It was not until editor Francis Hackett , showed the manuscript to Ben Huebsch , owner and editor of a small publishing house in New York , that the stories (Huebsch suggested calling them "Winesburg, Ohio") were brought together and published. [47]
The cycle consists of twenty-two short stories, one of which consists of four parts: [note 1]

The book is written as a third-person omniscient narrative with the narrator occasionally breaking away from the story to directly address the reader or make self-conscious comments (in "Hands", after describing the poignant nature of the story, he writes that "It is a job for a poet", [48] later in the same story adding, "It needs a poet there". [49] ) These remarks appear less often as the book progresses. [50]
Though each story's title notes one character, there are a total of over 100 characters named in the book, some appearing only once and some recurring several times. According to literary scholar Forrest L. Ingram, "George Willard [recurs] in all but six stories; 33 characters each appear in more than one story (some of them five and six times). Ninety-one characters appear only once in the cycle (ten of these are central protagonists in their stories)." [51] Within the stories, characters figure in anecdotes that cover a relatively large time period; much of the action takes place during George's teenage years, but there are also episodes that go back several generations (particularly in "Godliness"), approximately twenty years ("Hands"), and anywhere in between. Indeed, the climactic scenes of two stories, "The Strength of God" and "The Teacher", are actually juxtaposed over the course of one stormy January evening. As Malcolm Cowley writes in his introduction to the 1960 Viking edition of Winesburg, Ohio, Anderson's "...instinct was to present everything together, as in a dream". [52]
Major themes
The major themes of Winesburg, Ohio largely concern the interaction between the individual citizens of Winesburg and the world around them. As each of the book's stories focuses primarily (though not exclusively) on one character, the narrator develops these themes continuously, sometimes adding new insights about previously introduced characters (Elizabeth Willard's relationship with Dr. Reefy in "Death", for example, was never alluded to when she was first introduced in "Mother".). Because George Willard is a fixture in much of the book, his character arc becomes just as important a theme of Winesburg, Ohio as that of the rest of town's inhabitants.
Inability to communicate, loneliness, and isolation
The most prevalent theme in Winesburg, Ohio is the interplay between how the Winesburg citizens' "...inability to translate inner feelings into outward form" [53] expresses itself in the loneliness and isolation that makes their various adventures noteworthy. [54] This dynamic is present, in some form, in practically all of the stories, two fairly representative examples being the merchant's son, Elmer Cowley, in the story "Queer", and George's mother, Elizabeth Willard, in the stories, "Mother" and "Death".
In the former, the young man, Elmer Cowley, incited by an imagined slight ("He thought that the boy who passed and repassed Cowley & Son's store ...must be thinking of him and perhaps laughing at him" [55] when in reality, "[George] had long been wanting to make friends with the young merchant...") [56] tries twice to tell George off but is unable to communicate his feelings either time, finally physically assaulting the young reporter. The story ends with Cowley telling himself, " 'I showed him...I guess I showed him. I guess I showed him I ain't so queer", [57] a proclamation obviously laced with dramatic irony . [58] [59]
In the latter two stories, Elizabeth Willard was the "tall and gaunt...ghostly figure [moving] slowly through the halls..." [60] of the New Willard House who eventually, in "Death", succumbs to illness. In her youth, Elizabeth "...had been 'stage-struck' and, wearing loud clothes, paraded the streets with traveling men from her father's hotel". [61] She was a character who, "perhaps more than any of the other characters, seeks some kind of release from her perpetual loneliness". [61] And yet, aside from her very brief love affair with Dr. Reefy, [62] Elizabeth Willard finds no solace. Instead, both of her stories conclude with Elizabeth Willard attempting to communicate with her son but, like the dumbfounded Elmer Cowley, winding up unsuccessful.
Escaping isolation
In contrast with the stark view of Winesburg, Ohio above, a number of scholars have taken the perspective that the cycle is, in fact, about escape from isolation instead of the condition itself. [63] [64] Barry D. Bort writes, "Criticism of Winesburg, Ohio has recognized this desperate need to communicate, but what has not been understood about Anderson's work is that this continual frustration serves as the context out of which arise a few luminous moments of understanding...Such moments are at the heart of Winesburg, Ohio, although they are few and evanescent". [64] Though rarely does escape come in the narrative present, many of the stories prominently feature anecdotes of past adventures where lonely and reserved characters run naked through the town on a rainy night (Alice Hindman in "Adventure"), drive their wagon headlong into a speeding locomotive (Windpeter Winters in "The Untold Lie"), and have window-shattering religious epiphanies (Reverend Curtis Hartman in "The Strength of God"). While not all of the adventures are so dramatic, each has its place in the annals of the town, sometimes as told to George Willard, other times in the memories of participants.
George Willard's coming-of-age
George Willard, a young reporter for the Winesburg Eagle, figures prominently in much of Winesburg, Ohio. [note 2] Throughout the book, he plays the dual role of listener and recorder of other people's stories and advice, [65] [66] and the young representative of the town's hopes [67] whose coming-of-age reaches its dÃ©nouement in the final tale, "Departure", when George leaves Winesburg for the city. Much of George's development is centered around two interconnected threads: those of his sexual and artistic maturation. Most of the time, these two formative elements proceed together; it is solely when George loses his virginity to Louise Trunnion in "Nobody Knows" that the adventure is exclusively sexual. [68] Afterwards, starting with his desire to fall in love with Helen White in order to have material for a love story in "The Thinker", the desire for sexual fulfillment becomes linked to his literary/emotional sensibility. [68]
In "The Teacher", a central point in George's development, "Kate Swift, George's school teacher, realizes his literary potential..." [67] and tries to communicate her thoughts to George but, "...his sexual desire kindles her own, and she loses touch with the intellectual, spiritual, and creative potentials of her emotion. At last, however, George begins to perceive that there is something more to be communicated between men and women than physical encounter..." [68] Yet this lesson is not solidified for the young reporter when, after boasting in a bar in the story "An Awakening", he has a surge of "masculine power" and tries to seduce Belle Carpenter, only to be repelled and humiliated by her beau, the large-fisted bartender, Ed Handby.
The climax of George's sexual and artistic coming-of-age comes in the second-to-last story of the collection, "Sophistication". [69] Early in the story, while walking amongst the crowds of the Winesburg County Fair, George felt "...a thing known to men and unknown to boys. He felt old and little tired...[and]...he wanted someone to understand the feeling that had taken possession of him after his mother's death [an event that took place in, "Death", the previous story]". [70] That someone turned out to be Helen White, who herself had "...come to a period of change". [71] It is in the time they spend together that readers see "his acceptance of Helen as a spiritual mediator..." which signifies that "...George's masculinity is balanced by the feminine qualities of tenderness and gentleness, an integration that Anderson suggests is necessary for the artist." [72]
Style
The style of Winesburg, Ohio has often been placed at various points in the spectrum between the naturalism of Andersonâ€™s literary predecessor, William Dean Howells (who died almost one year after the publication of the book), contemporaries Theodore Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis , and the Modernist writers of the Lost Generation . [73] In what has been dubbed a "New Realism", [74] [75] Winesburg, Ohio surpasses the notion of the novel as an "objective report" [76] by making use of "lyrical, nostalgic, evocative," [77] even sentimental effects of nineteenth-century novels [78] in its depictions of what lies beneath the psychological surface of a midwestern town. In the book, Anderson reoriented the facts typical of realist novels by incorporating his characters' inner beliefs about themselves as part of "reality". [79]
The symbolism in Winesburg, Ohio plays a large role in allowing for this reorientation. Beginning with the idea of characters as grotesques whose "...grotesqueness is not merely a shield of deformity; it is also a remnant of misshapen feelings, what Dr. Reefy in the sketch 'Paper Pills' calls 'the sweetness of the twisted apples'". [80] The irony of the sweet, but twisted (meaning, in the sentimental Victorian tradition, internally inferior), [81] apples is that they are compared to Dr. Reefy's own knuckles that make a habit of stuffing crumpled notes bearing his thoughts unread into his pockets (itself a symbol of the "ineffectuality of human thought"). [82] Wing Biddlebaum, the subject of the story "Hands", likewise was "...forever striving to conceal [his hands] in his pockets or behind his back". [48] For Wing, his hands were "...the very index of his humanity", [83] with the potential to symbolize a continuum going from a general fear of sexuality [84] to sublimated homosexuality. [85] Wing Biddlebaum and Dr. Reefy are just two examples of how throughout Winesburg, Ohio, Anderson builds myriad themes by adding symbolic significance to gestures, [86] weather conditions and time of day, [87] and events, [88] among other features of the stories.
Another major characteristic of Winesburg, Ohio that separates its style from Anderson's contemporaries, as well as his previous novels, is the minimal role of plot. According to critic David Stouk's article "Anderson's Expressionist Art", "As an expressionist drama, there is little development of a story line in the Winesburg tales in term of cause and effect." [25] Indeed, it is this de-emphasis of traditional story elements in lieu of experimentation with language that provides both a link and a rift between Winesburg, Ohio and the novels of the following decades; [89] whereas the simple, stripped-down vernacular that Gertrude Stein found so appealing in Anderson's writing of the time became an exemplar of quintessential American style most famously associated with Ernest Hemingway, [90] the expressionistic portrayal of emotional states in Winesburg, Ohio was later, by some critics, considered "undisciplined" and "vague". [91] [92]
Literary significance and criticism
The critical reception to Winesburg, Ohio upon its publication in 1919 was mostly positive, [93] [94] even effusive. Hart Crane , for example, wrote that "...America should read this book on her knees," [95] while H.L. Mencken wrote that Winesburg, Ohio "...embodies some of the most remarkable writing done in America in our time". [96] Despite criticism that Andersonâ€™s "sordid tales" [31] were humorless, [29] and "mired...in plotlessness", [93] Winesburg, Ohio did well enough that it was reprinted several times, selling a total of about 3,000 copies by 1921. [note 3]
The popularity of Winesburg, Ohio among readers and critics has remained fairly high, only fluctuating slightly with Sherwood Andersonâ€™s literary reputation [94] which, while steady through the 1920s, began to decline in the 1930s, [97] until William L. Phillips, following the lukewarm reception of The Letters of Sherwood Anderson in 1953, commented that "...Anderson is out of fashion." [98] Throughout that decade, however, the author and his most popular book were the subject of a "...re-examination, if only as a neglected literary ancestor of the moderns." [99] Into the 1960s and beyond, this "re-examination" became a "reevaluation" [99] by critics who today generally consider Winesburg, Ohio a modern classic. [94]
Literary and cultural connections
Ray Bradbury has credited Winesburg, Ohio as an inspiration for his book The Martian Chronicles . [100] [101]
H. P. Lovecraft said that he wrote the short story " Arthur Jermyn " after he "had nearly fallen asleep over the tame backstairs gossip of Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio." [102]
Israeli writer Amos Oz writes in his biography A Tale of Love and Darkness that Winesburg, Ohio had a powerful influence on his writing, showing him that literature must not necessarily always be about heroes. Only after reading Anderson did he find the courage to start writing. [103]
Philip Roth 's 2008 novel Indignation is set, in part, at Winesburg College in Winesburg, Ohio. His protagonist holds a part-time job as a waiter at the "New Willard House", evoking the protagonist, George Willard, of Anderson's book. [104]
Henry Miller references the book on the first page of his novel Sexus (of The Rosy Crucifixion series). [105]
In the 1985 film, Heaven Help Us , Danni reads a passage from "Sophistication" to her grief-stricken father.
In the ABC television series, Pretty Little Liars , the book is given to the character Aria Montgomery by her English teacher, Ezra Fitz , with whom she is having an affair. He writes the inscription "When you need to leave Rosewood... Ezra" on the first page. [106]
