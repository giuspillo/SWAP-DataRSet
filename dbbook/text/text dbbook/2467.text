The Millionairess is a play written in 1936 by George Bernard Shaw. It tells the story of Epifania, a spoiled heiress, and her search for a suitor. Shaw wrote the play in 1936 expressly for Dame Edith Evans. Evans rejected the role, calling it "too icy". The Millionairess opened at the Malvern Festival with Sybil Thorndike as Epifania. The reception was lukewarm, and the play did not go to London. In the summer of 1952, Katharine Hepburn starred in The Millionairess for a ten-week run at the New Theatre in London's West End. The production, directed by Michael Benthall and co-starring Robert Helpmann and Cyril Ritchard, was widely praised. In October of 1952 it was brought to New York, where it played at the Shubert Theatre for ten weeks. A film version of The Millionairess was made in 1960, directed by Anthony Asquith and starring Sophia Loren and Peter Sellers.
