The Sadeian Woman and the Ideology of Pornography is a 1978 non-fiction book by Angela Carter. Given that many feminists, notably Andrea Dworkin, truly loathe de Sade, a feminist re-appraisal of his work might seem a strange thing; but that's just what this book is. Carter sees de Sade as being the first writer to see women as more than mere breeding machines, as more than just their biology and, as such, finds him liberating.
