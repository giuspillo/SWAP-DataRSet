What is Philosophy? (French: Qu'est-ce que la philosophie?) is a 1991 book by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari that deals with the distinction between philosophy and science, arguing that the former deals with concepts and the latter with functions. The work became a best-seller in France in 1991. Physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont write that Deleuze and Guattari's attempt to show how philosophy and science are distinct uses scientific terms such as "chaos" in incorrect or misleading ways. In Sokal and Bricmont's view, while some passages of the book seem to discuss serious problems in the philosophy of science and mathematics, they prove to be largely meaningless on close inspection.
