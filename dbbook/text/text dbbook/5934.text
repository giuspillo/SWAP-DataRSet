Gary M. Heidnik
In this novel, a killer employs methods used by real life serial rapist and murderer Gary M. Heidnik . The antagonist keeps his victims locked in the basement or put into "the hole" for extra punishment, which is a dug-out hole in the floor (partially filled with soiled water) where a victim is kept, covered with boards and water barrels to ensure captivity. The killer also employs the use of shock torture in a situation similar to the experience of one of Heidnik's victims, Josefina Rivera.
