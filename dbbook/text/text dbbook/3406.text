Pippi Longstocking is a 1945 children's novel by the Swedish writer Astrid Lindgren. Lindgren wrote the book for her 8-year-old daughter, who apparently was sick in bed.
Origin
Lindgren originally told Pippi stories to her daughter Karin in 1941, when the 7-year-old was home sick with pneumonia. She wrote the first manuscript during her own injury three years later. After it was rejected by Bonniers , Lindgren developed the nonsensical aspects further and submitted the revised version to the 1945 children's book contest sponsored by RabÃ©n & SjÃ¶gren , a rather new publisher.
Pippi won the contest that closed August 1, RabÃ©n & SjÃ¶gren arranged for illustrations by Ingrid Vang Nyman (her debut in Sweden), and the first edition was published in November.
Plot
The book focuses on the experiences of Pippi Longstocking, a nine-year-old pigtailed redhead whose father, a sea captain, has seemingly vanished at sea, so she moves into a big house known as "Villa Villekulla", located in a little Swedish village, with her pet monkey Mr. Nilsson, a suitcase filled with pieces of gold, and her unnamed pet horse. Gifted with superhuman strength and countless other eccentricities, Pippi is soon befriended by two local siblings named Annika and Tommy Settergren, who admire her and enjoy her company. Having spent her entire life at sea, Pippi's limited knowledge of common courtesy and average childhood behaviour adds humour to the story when she attempts to enroll at Tommy and Annika's school, attends a circus , and attends a coffee party hosted by Mrs. Settergren.
Series
The first four Pippi books were published in 1945â€“1948, with an additional series of six books published in 1969â€“1975. Two final stories were printed in 1979 and 2000.[ citation needed ]
