No One Writes to the Colonel (Spanish: El coronel no tiene quien le escriba) is a novella written by the Colombian novelist and Nobel Prize in Literature winner Gabriel García Márquez. It also gives its name to a short story collection.
Plot summary
The novel, written between 1956â€“1957 and first published in 1961, [1] is the story of an impoverished, retired colonel , a veteran of the Thousand Days' War , who still hopes to receive the pension he was promised some fifteen years earlier. The colonel lives with his asthmatic wife in a small village under martial law. The action opens with the colonel preparing to go to the funeral of a town musician whose death is notable because he was the first to die from natural causes in many years. The novel is set during the years of " La Violencia " in Colombia, when martial law and censorship prevail.

Literary significance and criticism
Unlike many other GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez works, the novel mostly does not fall within the magic realism genre, as it includes only one magical event.
The main characters of the novel are not named, adding to the feeling of insignificance of an individual living in Colombia. The colonel and his wife, who have lost their son to political repression, are struggling with poverty and financial instability. The corruption of the local and national officials is evident and this is a topic which GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez explores throughout the novel, by using references to censorship and the impact of government on society. The colonel desperately tries to sell their inheritance from their only son who is now dead and eventually the only reminder of his existence is a rooster that the colonel trains to take part in a cockfight.
In his memoir Vivir para contarla ( Living to Tell the Tale , 2002), GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez explained that the novel was inspired by his grandfather, who was also a colonel and who never received the pension he was promised. However, there is also speculation that MÃ¡rquez took inspiration from his experience of unemployment in 1956 after the newspaper he had been working for shut down. The daily lives he witnessed during this time are said to be one of his inspirations for this novel.
