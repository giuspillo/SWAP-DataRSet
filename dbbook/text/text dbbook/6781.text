The Tale of Little Pig Robinson is a children's book written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter and first published simultaneously in Britain by Frederick Warne & Co. and in America by David McKay Company in September 1930. The tale is the story of the pig in Edward Lear's "The Owl and the Pussycat" and how he came to "the land where the Bong tree grows". Potter spent a holiday in Lyme Regis when she was seventeen, and used views of Lyme Regis, nearby Sidmouth, Ilfracombe, Hastings, and Teignmouth Harbour as backgrounds in the book. Though her last published book, it was one of the first written.
