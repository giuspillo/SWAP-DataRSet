The Towers of Trebizond is a novel by Rose Macaulay (1881–1958). Published in 1956, it was the last of her novels, and the most successful. It was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction in the year of its publication.
Plot
The book is partly autobiographical. It follows the adventures of a group of people â€“ the narrator Laurie, the eccentric Dorothea ffoulkes-Corbett (otherwise Aunt Dot), her High Anglican clergyman friend Father Hugh Chantry-Pigg (who keeps his collection of sacred relics in his pockets), travelling from Istanbul (or Constantinople as Fr. Chantry-Pigg would have it) to Trebizond . A Turkish feminist doctor attracted to Anglicanism acts as a foil to the main characters. On the way, they meet magicians, Turkish policemen and juvenile British travel-writers, and observe the BBC and Billy Graham on tour. Aunt Dot proposes to emancipate the women of Turkey by converting them to Anglicanism and popularising the bathing hat, [1] while Laurie has more worldly preoccupations. Historical references (British Christianity since the Dissolution of the Monasteries , nineteenth-century travellers to the Ottoman Empire , the First World War, the Fourth Crusade , St. Paul's third missionary journey , Troy ) abound. The geographical canvas is enlarged with the two senior characters eloping to the Soviet Union and the heroine meeting her lover and her semi-estranged mother in Jerusalem . The final chapters after a fatal accident on the return journey raise multiple issues such as the souls of animals.
At another level the book, against its Anglo-Catholic backdrop, deals with the attractions of mystical Christianity and the conflict between Christianity and adultery. [2] This was a problem Macaulay had faced in her own life, having had an affair with the married novelist and former Roman Catholic priest Gerald O'Donovan (1871â€“1942) from 1920 until his death. [3]
The famous opening sentence is, [4] [5]
â€œ
"Take my camel, dear", said my Aunt Dot, as she climbed down from this animal on her return from High Mass.

The Turkish woman doctor says in the book of Aunt Dot, "She is a woman of dreams. Mad dreams, dreams of crazy, impossible things. And they aren't all of conversion to the Church, oh no. Nor all of the liberation of women, oh no. Her eyes are on far mountains, always some far peak where she will go. She looks so firm and practical, that nice face, so fair and plump and shrewd, but look in her eyes, you will sometimes catch a strange gleam." [4]
Barbara Reynolds has suggested that the character of Aunt Dot is based on Rose Macaulay's friend Dorothy L. Sayers , and that Father Hugh Chantry-Pigg has elements of Frs. Patrick McLaughlin , Gilbert Shaw and Gerard Irvine . [6]
The book was described in The New York Times : "Fantasy, farce, high comedy, lively travel material, delicious japes at many aspects of the frenzied modern world, and a succession of illuminating thoughts about love, sex, life, organized churches and religion are all tossed together with enchanting results."

The importance of the camel in The Towers of Trebizond is difficult to define. One reading may be that it serves as both a physical and metaphorical vehicle that helps Laurie explore her spirituality while she discovers the Turkish countryside and journeys to Jerusalem.
The camel itself is unnamed and described as "a white Arabian Dhalur (single hump) from the famous herd of the Ruola tribe" and as an "unconcerned Moslem". As camels go, Aunt Dot's is portrayed as being higher, or more special, than other camels: â€œâ€¦it was the one camel, among sheep and calves and donkeys and pigs, and stood looking tall and white and distinguished, showing raceâ€¦â€�.
When Aunt Dot leaves the camel to Laurie, a new depth of meaning is brought to the famous first line of the novel: â€œTake my camel, dearâ€¦â€�. As Laurie rides the camel on her journey, it becomes a physical vehicle that takes her through Biblical lands that, to her, seem alive with ancient history and mythology: â€œâ€¦and that I and the camel were part of the gorgeous pageant of the Eastâ€� (189). However, Laurieâ€™s journey is more than just a trek through the desert on an Arabian racing camel. Her true journey, with the help of the camel, is a spiritual pilgrimage to Jerusalem, which is the spiritual and biblical seat of religion: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
On her pilgrimage, she is free of the influences of Aunt Dot and Father Chantry-Pigg. Alone with the camel, she is able to explore her own feelings and thoughts about religion, right and wrong, truth and untruth: â€œBelieve it? What does believe mean? You donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t know. So I believe what I want. Anyhow, itâ€™s in the blood; I probably canâ€™t help itâ€�. The camel in The Towers of Trebizond facilitates Laurieâ€™s search for a deeper meaning of the divine truth of religion than what Christianity offers.
