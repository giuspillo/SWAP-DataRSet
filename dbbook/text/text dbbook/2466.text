Sharpe's Trafalgar is a historical novel by Bernard Cornwell, a Sharpe adventure in a different setting. Cornwell blends Sharpe's history into this greatest of Britain's sea triumphs. Sharpe meets a new set of characters, rogues, rascals and heroes, including a personal meeting with Lord Nelson. He also has a love affair and plays a major role in the battle. Even though it is highly unlikely that a character such as Sharpe could have been at the Battle of Trafalgar, Cornwell makes his presence there plausible.
Plot introduction
Sharpe's Trafalgar is a nautical adventure that finds ensign Richard Sharpe in the middle of one of history's most historically significant naval engagements: the battle at Cape Trafalgar off the west coast of Spain, in 1805.
Plot summary
The year is 1805, and Richard Sharpe is heading from India to England aboard the cargo ship Calliope. Also on board is the lovely Lady Grace Hale, whose presence promises to provide intrigue and distraction to an otherwise uneventful voyage home.
Uneventful the voyage is not, for the Calliope is captured by a formidable French warship, the Revenant. The French warship is headed to its own fleet, carrying a stolen treaty that, if delivered, could provoke Indians into a new war against the British.
The arrival of Admiral Horatio Nelson's well-led fleet results in a breathtaking retelling of one of the most ferocious and one-sided sea battles in European history, in which Nelson, and Sharpe, vanquish the combined naval might of France and Spain at Trafalgar.
