All My Sons is a 1947 play by Arthur Miller. The play was twice adapted for film; in 1948, and again in 1987. The play opened on Broadway at the Coronet Theatre in New York City on January 29, 1947, closed on November 8, 1947 and ran for 328 performances. It was directed by Elia Kazan (to whom it is dedicated) and won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, beating Eugene O’Neill’s The Iceman Cometh. It starred Ed Begley, Beth Miller, Arthur Kennedy, and Karl Malden and won both the Tony Award for Best Author and the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play.
Background
Miller wrote All My Sons after his first play The Man Who Had All the Luck failed on Broadway , lasting only four performances. Miller wrote All My Sons as a final attempt at writing a commercially successful play; he vowed to "find some other line of work" [1] if the play did not find an audience.
All My Sons is based upon a true story, which Arthur Miller's then mother-in-law pointed out in an Ohio newspaper. [3] The news story described how in 1941-43 the Wright Aeronautical Corporation based in Ohio had conspired with army inspection officers to approve defective aircraft engines destined for military use. [3] [4] The story of defective engines had reached investigators working for Sen. Harry Truman 's congressional investigative board after several Wright aircraft assembly workers informed on the company; they would later testify under oath before Congress. [3] [4] In 1944, three Army Air Force officers, Lt. Col. Frank C. Greulich, Major Walter A. Ryan, and Major William Bruckmann were relieved and later convicted of neglect of duty. [5] [6] [7]
Henrik Ibsen 's influence on Miller is evidenced from the Ibsen play The Wild Duck , where Miller took the idea of two partners in a business where one is forced to take moral and legal responsibility for the other. This is mirrored in All My Sons. He also borrowed the idea of a characterâ€™s idealism being the source of a problem. [8]
The criticism of the American Dream , which lies at the heart of All My Sons, was one reason why Arthur Miller was called to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee during the 1950s, when America was gripped by anti-communist hysteria. Miller sent a copy of the play to Elia Kazan who directed the original stage version of All My Sons. Kazan was a former member of the Communist Party who shared Miller's left-wing views. However, their relationship was destroyed when Kazan gave names of suspected Communists to the House Un-American Activities Committee during the Red Scare . [1] [9]
Characters
Joe Keller - Joe, 60, was exonerated after being charged with shipping damaged aircraft engine cylinder heads (for P-40s ) out of his factory during WWII , inadvertently causing the deaths of 21 pilots. For three and a half years he has placed the blame on his partner and former neighbor, Steve Deever. When the truth comes out, Joe justifies his actions by claiming that he did it for his family. At the end of the play he commits suicide in a sad attempt to rid his family of the problems he has caused them and perhaps also to stop Kate from hating him.
Kate Keller (Mother) - Kate knows that Joe is guilty but lives in denial while mourning for her elder son Larry, who has been MIA for three years. She refuses to believe that Larry is dead and maintains that Ann Deever - who returns for a visit at the request of Larry's brother Chris - is still "Larry's girl" and also believes that he is coming back.
Chris Keller â€“ Chris, 32, returned home from World War II two years before the play begins, disturbed by the realization that the world was continuing as if nothing had happened. He has summoned Ann Deever to the Keller house in order to ask her hand in marriage, but they're faced with the obstacle of Kate's unreasonable conviction that Larry will someday return. Chris's idolization of his father results in his devastation when he finds out the truth about what Joe did.
Ann Deever - Ann, 26, arrives at the Keller home having shunned their 'guilty' father since his imprisonment. Throughout the play, Ann is often referred to as pretty, beautiful, and intelligent-looking and as "Annie". She had a relationship with Larry Keller before his disappearance, and has since moved on because she knows the truth of his fate. She hopes that the Kellers will consent to her marriage with Larry's brother, Chris, with whom she has corresponded by mail for two years. Ann soon finds out that the neighbors all believe that Joe is guilty, and eventually finds out the truth after a visit from her older brother George. Ann is the knowledge-bearer in the play: finally, unable to convince Kate that Larry is gone forever, Ann reveals a letter from Larry stating his intention to commit suicide having learned of his fatherâ€™s implied guilt.
George Deever â€“ George, 31, is Annâ€™s older brother: a successful New York lawyer and WWII veteran, and a childhood friend of Chris. He initially believed in his fatherâ€™s guilt, but upon visiting Steve in jail, realizes his innocence and becomes enraged at the Kellers for deceiving him. He returns to save his sister from her marriage to Chris, creating the catalyst that destroys the Keller family.
Jim Bayliss â€“ Jim is a successful doctor, but is frustrated with the stifling domesticity of his life. He wants to become a medical researcher, but continues in his job as it pays the bills. He is a close friend to the Keller family and spends a lot of time in their backyard.
Sue Bayliss - Sue is Jim's wife: needling and dangerous but affectionate, she too is a friend of the Keller family, but is secretly resentful of what she sees as Chris's bad idealistic influence on Jim. Sue confronts Ann about her resentment of Chris in a particularly volatile scene, revealing to Ann that the neighbors all think Joe is guilty.
Frank Lubey â€“ Frank, 32, was always one year ahead of the draft, so he never served in World War II, instead staying home to marry George's former sweetheart, Lydia. He draws up Larry's horoscope and tells Kate that Larry must still be alive, because the day he died was meant to be his 'favorable day.' This strengthens Kate's faith and makes it much harder for Ann to reveal the letter to her.
Lydia Lubey - Lydia, 27, was George's love interest before the war; after he went away, she married Frank and they quickly had three children. She is a model of peaceful domesticity and lends a much-needed cheerful air to several moments of the play.
Bert â€“ Bert is a little boy who lives in the neighborhood; he is friends with the Bayliss' son Tommy and frequently visits the Kellers' yard to play "jail" with Joe. He only appears twice in the play. The first time he appears, his part seems pretty unimportant, but the second time he appears his character gets more important as he sparks a verbal attack from mother when mentioning "jail," which highlights Joe's secret.
Unseen characters
Larry Keller - Larry has been MIA for some years at the start of the play, however he has an effect in the play through his mother's insistence that he is still alive and his brother's love for his childhood sweetheart. Comparisons are made in the story between Larry and Chris with their father describing Larry as the more sensible one with a "head" for business. At the end of the play, Ann reveals a letter written by Larry pronouncing him committing suicide out of shame for what his father did.
Steve Deever - ("Herbert Deever" in the 1948 movie) George and Ann's father. Steve is sent to prison for the shipping of faulty parts - a crime which he and the successfully exonerated Keller committed.
Deever does appear in the 1948 film, in an additional scene not found in the play. In this scene, Chris goes to visit Steve in prison, where Steve reveals the truth about what Joe Keller did.
Act I
In August 1946 Joe Keller, a self-made businessman, is visited by neighbour, Frank. At the request of Kate, Joe's wife, Frank is trying to figure out the horoscope of the Kellers' missing son Larry, who disappeared three years earlier. While Kate still believes Larry is coming back, the Kellers' other son Chris believes otherwise. Furthermore, Chris wishes to propose to Ann Deever, who was Larry's girlfriend at the time he went missing and who has been corresponding with Chris for two years. Joe and Kate react to this news with shock but are interrupted by Bert, the boy next door. When Bert brings up the jail Kate reacts sharply. After Ann Deever enters, it is revealed that Ann's father, Steve Deever, is in prison for selling cracked cylinder heads to the Air Force, causing twenty-one planes to crash. Joe was his partner but was exonerated of the crime. Ann admits that neither she nor her brother keep in touch with their father anymore and wonders aloud whether this was responsible for Larry's death. After a heated argument Chris breaks in and later proposes to Ann, who says yes. Chris also reveals that, while leading a company, he lost all his men and is experiencing survivor's guilt. Meanwhile, Joe receives a phone call from George, Ann's brother, who is coming there to settle something.
Act II
While Chris avoids telling his mom about the engagement, their next door neighbor Sue emerges and reveals that everyone on the block still thinks Joe is guilty. Shortly thereafter George arrives and reveals that he has just been to visit his father. Steve Deever had been told by Joe to cover up the cracked cylinders and send them out; Joe is equally guilty of the crime. George insists Ann will not marry Chris, son of the man who destroyed their family. Joe and the rest of the family deny this, but Kate reveals that Joe hasn't been sick in fifteen years. Since Joe's story was that the flu laid him up on that fateful day, George attacks them once more. Frank comes in with the horoscope, which implies that Larry is alive, which is just what Kate wants to hear. Chris, however, is furious at his father despite Joe's explanations that he was merely building a business for his sons, which Chris never accepted.
Act III
Chris has gone missing. Kate, having finally believed the accusations, tells Joe that Chris should come back, Joe must turn himself in. Joe, who only made money because his family wanted to, is stunned at how they are turning on him. Ann emerges soon after and reveals to Kate that she has a letter from Larry. She hadn't wanted to share it, but she knows that Kate must face reality. In the letter, Larry confesses that he plans to kill himself because of his father's guilt. With this final blow, Joe says he'll turn himself in, goes inside to get his coat, then kills himself with a gunshot to the head. At the end, Chris reveals this, and Kate tells him to not blame himself.

Links to Greek tragedy
Arthur Millerâ€™s writing in All My Sons often shows great respect for the great Grecian tragedies of the likes of Aeschylus , Sophocles and Euripides . In these plays the tragic hero or protagonist will commit an offence, often unknowingly, which will return to haunt him, sometimes many years later. The play encapsulates all the fallout from the offense into a 24 hour time span. During that day, the protagonist must learn his fault and suffer as a result, and perhaps even die. In this way the gods are shown to be just and moral order is restored. In All My Sons, these elements are all present; it takes place within a 24 hour period, has a protagonist suffering from a previous offense, and punishment for that offense. Additionally, it explores the father-son relationship, also a common theme in Grecian tragedies. Ann Deever could also be seen to parallel a messenger as her letter is proof of Larry's death.
In Joe Keller, Arthur Miller creates just a representative type. Joe is a very ordinary man, decent, hard-working and charitable, a man no-one could dislike. But, like the protagonist of the ancient drama, he has a flaw or weakness. This, in turn, causes him to act wrongly. He is forced to accept responsibility - his suicide is necessary to restore the moral order of the universe, and allows his son, Chris, to live free from guilt and persecution. Arthur Miller later uses the everyman in a criticism of the American Dream in Death of a Salesman , which is in many ways similar to All My Sons.
Arthur Miller quotation on All My Sons
At the start of Arthur Miller's Collected Plays he commented on his feelings on watching an audience's reaction to a performance of his first successful play:
The success of a play, especially one's first success, is somewhat like pushing against a door which is suddenly opened from the other side. One may fall on one's face or not, but certainly a new room is opened that was always securely shut until then. For myself, the experience was invigorating. It made it possible to dream of daring more and risking more. The audience sat in silence before the unwinding of All My Sons and gasped when they should have, and I tasted that power which is reserved, I imagine, for playwrights, which is to know that by one's invention a mass of strangers has been publicly transfixed.
