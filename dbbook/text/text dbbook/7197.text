A Short History of the World is a period-piece non-fictional historic work by H.G. Wells first published by Cassell & Co, Ltd Publishing in 1922. It was republished under Penguin Classics in 2006. The book was largely inspired by Wells earlier 1919 work The Outline of History. The book is 344 pages in total, and tells of the history of the world, starting with the believed origins of the Earth around 2,000 million years ago, now thought to be 4,404 million years according to 2005 estimates. The book then goes on to explain the, at the time believed, development of the Earth and life on Earth, until reaching primitive thought and the development of humankind from the Cradle of Civilisation. The book ends with the outcome of the First World War, the Russian famine of 1921, and the League of Nations in 1922.
