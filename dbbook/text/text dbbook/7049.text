The Men Who Stare at Goats (2004) is a book by Jon Ronson about the U.S. Army's exploration of New Age concepts and the potential military applications of the paranormal. The title refers to attempts to kill goats by staring at them. Research was carried out in part by Jon Ronson, but also by documentary filmmaker John Sergeant.
Primary themes
The book examines connections between military programs and psychological techniques being used for interrogation in the War on Terror . The book traces the evolution of these covert activities over the previous three decades, and analyzes how they persisted within U.S. Homeland Security and the Iraq War . It examines the use of the theme tune to Barney & Friends on Iraqi prisoners-of-war, the shipment of a hundred de-bleated goats into the Special Forces command center at Fort Bragg , North Carolina for use in the now-decommissioned [2] "Goat Lab" formerly used to train Special Forces medics, and the connection between the U.S. military and the mass-suicide of members of the Heaven's Gate cult in San Diego .

TV documentary
The book accompanies a three-part TV series broadcast on Channel 4 in Britain, Crazy Rulers of the World. The three parts were titled "The Men Who Stare at Goats", "Funny Torture" and "The Psychic Footsoldiers" respectively. The idea of the project was to explore "the apparent madness at the heart of U.S. military intelligence." The series discusses and includes members of Psychological operations , First Earth Battalion , and also discusses Project MKULTRA and Frank Olson , including interviews with his son, Eric Olson.
Ronson dedicated his book to filmmaker John Sergeant, who worked intensely through 2003 and 2004 on the documentary, and Ronson included an afterword commending Sergeant's research and guidance. [1] [4]
