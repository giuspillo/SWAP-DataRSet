Indemnity Only is a mystery novel written by Sara Paretsky.
Summary
V. I. Warshawski , a private detective, is employed by a man who calls himself John Thayer to find his son's girlfriend, Anita Hill. However, as she begins her search, V.I. almost immediately comes across Peter Thayer, John's son, dead. Her investigation takes a definite turn as she discovers ulterior motives for Anita's whereabouts to be found. In her search, Warshawski also discovers that the man who claims to be John Thayer turns out to be Andrew McGraw, the father of Anita Hill and a big labor union leader. It is later revealed that Anita Hill herself does not exist, that her real name is Anita McGraw, and she had reasons for running after Peter's murder that lead into a case much bigger than murder. It is quickly let on that our detective knows too much as she takes a beating from gang member Earl Smeissen early on. While Vic attempts to figure out who murdered Peter, she comes across many different roadblocks, including that in the same week, the real John Thayer is also killed, which turns her on to scams and connections in between the Knifegrinders labor union, the Ajax Insurance Company, and the Fort Dearborn Trust. Turns out that one of Earl's henchmen was identified at the scene of the crime by a witness. She utilizes Peter's younger sister, Jill Thayer, for personal family information and private documentation in her deceased father's office that support Vic's suspicions of insurance fraud, which Peter had first discovered. Throughout all this, Vic had been keeping her personal relationship with Ralph Devereaux away from the nonsense, up until the very end when it's discovered that his boss, Yardley Masters, has been not only orchestrating these crimes and frauds, but also even doing some of the killing himself. The novel ends in a dramatic scene at Ralph's apartment with Jill being held hostage by the aforementioned gangsters and Yardley trying to strike again. Vic, using her expert fighting skills and quick deduction abilities previously demonstrated in the book, averts his attacks and actually counters with life-saving moves for all the innocent people in the room. The book ends full circle with Anita finally being reunited with her father, but with a question of forgiveness in the air.
Writing style
Sara Paretsky is best well known for her feminist perspective in her novels. This feminist writing style may have been started when Paretsky became â€œsocially and politically active, especially in helping the lobby for abortion rights and later, after the passage of Roe v. Wade, becoming active in the National Abortion Rights Action Leagueâ€�. (Wyrick) Therefore, she tends to lean toward female independence in her novels, probably because it affected her more personally than other authors. A feminist kind of writing style might have also been started when Paretsky was with her young â€œfrustration with traditional gender roles, voiced in her novels by different characters, but most consistently espoused by Lieutenant Bobby Mallory, that partly motivated the strong feminist tone her novels takeâ€� (Wyrick). Paretsky's writing style is mostly influenced by feminism, but she uses her "expertise in the insurance business" (Wyrick) as a background when she wrote Indemnity Only. [7]
Themes
Feminism and Gender Equality
"Sara Paretsky, author of a series of mystery novels featuring detective V.I Warshawski, is known for bringing a feminist perspective to the hard-boiled Private Eye genre."(Hileman) Throughout the first book of the series, Indemnity Only, the idea of a strong female lead character is taking shape. Paretsky believed that female's need to be confident in what they do. In an interview conducted by Monica Hileman for Sojourner: The Women's Forum, Paretsky says that: "It's important for women to develop confidence in their bodies. I think it's encouraging to have characters like V.I who are confident and can hold their own physically as well as verbally."(Hileman) Paretsky is not saying that women are better than men, but that women are capable of doing what men can do especially in law related careers. [8] Paretsky used her thoughts of feminism to mold the main character, Warshawski. Ann Wilson describes Warshawski as follows: "The primary appeal is readily evident; a heroine modeled on a hard-boiled detective is a woman who is self-reliant and independent, a prototype of a feminist ideal." This sort of woman was not common in the current detective fiction pieces. "The conventional representation of the female body as weaker than a man's and therefore less effective in situations which require physical power is exposed by Paretsky as a ruse: each author puts her heroine in situations which require agility of mind and body."(Wilson) Paretsky's P.I Warshawksi opened the door to a new generation of detective writing.

Critical reception
â€œParetsky's first novel received favorable reviews. Publishers Weekly called Indemnity Only "the start of a very promising new mystery series," while Chicago Magazine compared Paretsky's integration of character and environment to past masters of the genre Dashiell Hammett and Chandler. In the 3 March 1982 issue of The New Republic, crime-fiction critic Robin W. Winks described the novel as "thoroughly convincing."â€�
Character list
V.I. Warshawski- Vick Warshawski is a private detective, who goes on the search for Anita McGraw only to uncover a much more twisted plot of serial murders, thugs, and insurance fraud.

Ralph Deveraux- A good looking man that works for Yardley Masters, who V.I Warshawski strikes up somewhat of a relationship with.
John Thayer-The father of the dead Peter Thayer. Works for Yardley Masters as well. Also the banker that signed off and helped with the insurance scam.
Bobby- A cop who is also trying to find Anita â€œHillâ€�. He also disapproves of V.I.â€™s tactics, mostly because he was a close friend of her father, Tony Warshawski, and knew V.I. since she was young.
Anita McGraw- Peter Thayerâ€™s girlfriend that has disappeared. VI Warshawski is in search of her while she hides from the thugs who want to silence her for the illegal information she has about Ajax Insurance.

Jill Thayer- Daughter of John Thayer and the sister of Peter Thayer. She seems to be the only one that cares about Peter.
