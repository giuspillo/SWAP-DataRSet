Scrambled Eggs Super! is a 1953 book by American children's author Dr. Seuss. It tells of a boy named Peter T. Hooper, who makes scrambled eggs prepared from eggs of various exotic birds.
Plot
At the beginning of the story, Peter T. Hooper brags to a girl, Liz, in his mother's kitchen about how good of a cook he is. He tells the story of how, when he became fed up with the taste of regular scrambled eggs using hen's eggs, he decided to scramble eggs from other birds. He tells of how he travelled great distances and discovered a variety of exotic birds and their eggs. He explains his criteria for choosing some eggs, because of their sweetness, and avoiding others. He takes the eggs home but decides that he still needs more, and he calls on the help of some friends he knows from around the world, including a "fellow named Ali".
Critical reception
Ruth C. Barlow of the Christian Science Monitor called it a "gay extravaganza". [1]
It also received positive reviews from Chicago Sunday Tribune and The New York Herald Tribune for Seuss's illustrations of the birds. [2]
Phillip Nel, in the book Dr. Seuss: American Icon, wrote that Scrambled Eggs Super! was one of Seuss's less politically oriented books. [3]
