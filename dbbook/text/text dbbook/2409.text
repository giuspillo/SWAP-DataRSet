The Waste Land is a 434-line modernist poem by T. S. Eliot published in 1922. It has been called "one of the most important poems of the 20th century. " Despite the poem's obscurity—its shifts between satire and prophecy, its abrupt and unannounced changes of speaker, location and time, its elegiac but intimidating summoning up of a vast and dissonant range of cultures and literatures—the poem has become a familiar touchstone of modern literature. Among its famous phrases are "April is the cruellest month," "I will show you fear in a handful of dust," and the mantra in the Sanskrit language "Shantih shantih shantih."
Publishing history
Before the editing had even begun Eliot found a publisher. [E] Horace Liveright of the New York publishing firm of Boni and Liveright was in Paris for a number of meetings with Ezra Pound. At a dinner on 3 January 1922 (see 1922 in poetry ), he made offers for works by Pound, James Joyce ( Ulysses ) and Eliot. Eliot was to get a royalty of 15% for a book version of the poem planned for autumn publication. [10]
To maximise his income and reach a broader audience, Eliot also sought a deal with magazines. Being the London correspondent for The Dial magazine [11] and a college friend of its co-owner and co-editor, Scofield Thayer , the Dial was an ideal choice. Even though the Dial offered $150 (Â£34) [12] for the poem (25% more than its standard rate) Eliot was offended that a year's work would be valued so low, especially since another contributor was found to have been given exceptional compensation for a short story. [13] The deal with the Dial almost fell through (other magazines considered were the Little Review and Vanity Fair), but with Pound's efforts eventually a deal was worked out where, in addition to the $150, Eliot would be awarded the Dial magazine's second annual prize for outstanding service to letters. The prize carried an award of $2,000 (Â£450). [14]
In New York in the late summer (with John Quinn, a lawyer and literary patron, representing Eliot's interests) Boni and Liveright made an agreement with The Dial allowing the magazine to be the first to publish the poem in the US if they agreed to purchase 350 copies of the book at discount from Boni and Liveright. [15] Boni and Liveright would use the publicity of the award of the Dial's prize to Eliot to increase their initial sales.
The poem was first published in the UK, without the author's notes, in the first issue (October 1922) of The Criterion , a literary magazine started and edited by Eliot. The first appearance of the poem in the US was in the November 1922 issue of The Dial magazine (actually published in late October). In December 1922, the poem was published in the US in book form by Boni and Liveright, the first publication to print the notes. In September 1923, the Hogarth Press , a private press run by Eliot's friends Leonard and Virginia Woolf , published the first UK book edition of The Waste Land in an edition of about 450 copies, the type handset by Virginia Woolf.
The publication history of The Waste Land (as well as other pieces of Eliot's poetry and prose) has been documented by Donald Gallup. [16]
Eliot, whose 1922 salary at Lloyds Bank was Â£500 ($2,215) [17] made approximately Â£630 ($2,800) with the Dial, Boni and Liveright and Hogarth Press publications. [18] [F]
Title
Eliot originally considered titling the poem He do the Police in Different Voices. [19] In the version of the poem Eliot brought back from Switzerland, the first two sections of the poemâ€”'The Burial of the Dead' and 'A Game of Chess'â€”appeared under this title. This strange phrase is taken from Charles Dickens ' novel Our Mutual Friend , in which the widow Betty Higden says of her adopted foundling son Sloppy, "You mightn't think it, but Sloppy is a beautiful reader of a newspaper. He do the Police in different voices." Some critics use this working title to support the theory that, while there are many different voices (speakers) in the poem, there is only one central consciousness. What was lost by the rejection of this title Eliot might have felt compelled to restore by commenting on the commonalities of his characters in his note about Tiresias , stating that 'What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance of the poem.'
In the end, the title Eliot chose was The Waste Land. In his first note to the poem he attributes the title to Jessie L. Weston 's book on the Grail legend, From Ritual to Romance . The allusion is to the wounding of the Fisher King and the subsequent sterility of his lands. To restore the King and make his lands fertile again the Grail questor must ask "What ails you?" A poem strikingly similar in theme and language called Waste Land, written by Madison Cawein , was published in 1913. [20]
The poem's title is often mistakenly given as "Waste Land" (as used by Weston) or "Wasteland", omitting the definite article . However, in a letter to Ezra Pound , Eliot politely insisted that the title was three words beginning with "The". [21]
Structure
The epigraph and dedication to The Waste Land showing some of the languages that Eliot used in the poem: Latin, Greek, English and Italian.
The poem is preceded by a Latin and Greek epigraph from The Satyricon of Petronius . In English, it reads: "I saw with my own eyes the Sibyl of Cumae hanging in a jar, and when the boys said to her, Sibyl, what do you want? she replied I want to die."
Following the epigraph is a dedication (added in a 1925 republication) that reads "For Ezra Pound : il miglior fabbro". Here Eliot is both quoting line 117 of Canto XXVI of Dante 's Purgatorio , the second cantica of The Divine Comedy , where Dante defines the troubadour Arnaut Daniel as "the best smith of the mother tongue", and also Pound's title of chapter 2 of his The Spirit of Romance (1910) where he translated the phrase as "the better craftsman". [22] This dedication was originally written in ink by Eliot in the 1922 Boni & Liveright edition of the poem presented to Pound; it was subsequently included in future editions. [23]
The five parts of The Waste Land are titled:
The Burial of the Dead
A Game of Chess
Death by Water
What the Thunder Said
The text of the poem is followed by several pages of notes, purporting to explain his metaphors, references, and allusions. Some of these notes are helpful in interpreting the poem, but some are arguably even more puzzling, and many of the most opaque passages are left unannotated. The notes were added after Eliot's publisher requested something longer to justify printing The Waste Land in a separate book. [G] Thirty years after publishing the poem with these notes, Eliot expressed his regret at "having sent so many enquirers off on a wild goose chase after Tarot cards and the Holy Grail". [24]
There is some question as to whether Eliot originally intended The Waste Land to be a collection of individual poems (additional poems were supplied to Pound for his comments on including them) or to be considered one poem with five sections.
The structure of the poem is also meant to loosely follow the vegetation myth and Holy Grail folklore surrounding the Fisher King story as outlined by Jessie Weston in her book From Ritual to Romance (1920). Weston's book was so central to the structure of the poem that it was the first text that Eliot cited in his "Notes on the Waste Land".
Style
The style of the work in part grows out of Eliot's interest in exploring the possibilities of dramatic monologue . This interest dates back at least as far as The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock . "The Waste Land" is not a single monologue like "Prufrock". Instead, it is made up of a wide variety of voices (sometimes in monologue, dialogue, or with more than two characters speaking).
The style of the poem overall is marked by the hundreds of allusions and quotations from other texts (classic and obscure; "high-brow" and "low-brow") that Eliot peppered throughout the poem. In addition to the many "high-brow" references and/or quotes from poets like Baudelaire , Shakespeare , Ovid , and Homer , Eliot also included a couple of references to "low-brow" genres. A good example of this is Eliot's quote from the 1912 popular song "The Shakespearian Rag" by lyricists Herman Ruby and Gene Buck . [25] There were also a number of low-brow references in the opening section of Eliot's original manuscript (when the poem was entitled "He Do The Police in Different Voices"), but they were removed from the final draft after Eliot cut this original opening section. [26]
"The Waste Land" is notable for its seemingly disjointed structure, indicative of the Modernist style of James Joyce 's Ulysses (which Eliot cited as an influence and which he read the same year that he was writing "The Waste Land"). [27] In the Modernist style, Eliot jumps from one voice or image to another without clearly delineating these shifts for the reader. He also includes phrases from multiple foreign languages (Latin, Greek, Italian, German, French and Sanskrit), indicative of Pound's influence.
Sources from which Eliot quotes, or to which he alludes, include the works of: Homer , Sophocles , Petronius , Virgil , Ovid , [28] Saint Augustine of Hippo , Dante Alighieri , William Shakespeare , Edmund Spenser , GÃ©rard de Nerval , Thomas Kyd , Geoffrey Chaucer , Thomas Middleton , John Webster , Joseph Conrad , John Milton , Andrew Marvell , Charles Baudelaire , Richard Wagner , Oliver Goldsmith , Hermann Hesse , Aldous Huxley , Paul Verlaine , Walt Whitman and Bram Stoker .
Eliot also makes extensive use of Scriptural writings including the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer , the Hindu Brihadaranyaka Upanishad , and the Buddha 's Fire Sermon , and of cultural and anthropological studies such as Sir James Frazer 's The Golden Bough and Jessie Weston 's From Ritual to Romance (particularly its study of the Wasteland motif in Celtic mythology ). Eliot wrote in the original head note that "Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L Weston" [H] The symbols Eliot employs, in addition to the Waste Land, include the Fisher King , the Tarot Deck, the Chapel perilous , and the Grail Quest.
