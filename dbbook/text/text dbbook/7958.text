Plot summary
Matt is being punished for a crime he saw, but didn't commit. Instead of being locked up, he is being sent to a strange cottage in Lesser Malling to live with a new foster mother, as part of a government scheme called The L.E.A.F Project. But Matt's new home provides anything but peace and quiet. His new guardian is involved in very sinister things . . . and the whole town seems to be against him. Everybody who tries to help Matt winds up disappearing and dead. The truth is much bigger than Matt or the town -- but Matt is the only person who can stop the ultimate evil from being unleashed.
