Dynah is a young Christian college girl at a bible college when rape shatters her life, and then the resulting pregnancy may shatter her faith.

At home she finds her family torn apart as her mother admits to an abortion before she had Dynah that made her incapable of having children for several years, and her grandmother admits to an abortion that was forced on her for "health reasons".
