Plot synopsis
The main characters include William Rackham, the unwilling heir to a perfume business; Agnes, William's brittle, long-suffering "mad wife in the attic"; and Sugar, a decidedly unconventional and strong-willed young prostitute whose intense affair with William gives her the opportunity to climb to a higher perch in the rigidly stratified class system of the time. Other characters include Henry Rackham, William's pious brother who wants to be a clergyman , and his friend Emmeline Fox, a widow who works in the Rescue Society that tries to reform prostitutes.
Style
The novel is told from the perspective of all of the main characters, and the omniscient narrator occasionally addresses the reader directly. There is also a meta-literary aspect, as Sugar is working on her own novel, Henry writes sermons, and Agnes keeps a diary.
Reception
The novel was generally well received by critics, with one review calling it 'supremely literary' and describing the quality of the writing as 'dizzyingly accomplished'. [1]
