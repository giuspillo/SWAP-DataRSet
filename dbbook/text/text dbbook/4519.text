Fateless or Fatelessness (Hungarian: Sorstalanság, lit. "Fatelessness") is a novel by Imre Kertész, winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize for literature, written between 1969 and 1973 and first published in 1975. The novel is a semi-autobiographical story about a 14-year-old Hungarian Jew's experiences in the Auschwitz and Buchenwald concentration camps. The book is the first part of a trilogy, which continues in A kudarc and Kaddis a meg nem született gyermekért ("Kaddish for an Unborn Child" ISBN 1-4000-7862-8). Kertész won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2002, "for writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history". The book was first published in English in 1992 as Fateless, while in 2004 a second translation appeared under the correctly translated title Fatelessness.
Plot summary
The novel is about a young Hungarian boy, GyÃ¶rgy "Gyuri" KÃ¶ves, living in Budapest . The book opens as GyÃ¶rgy's father is being sent to a labor camp. Soon afterwards, GyÃ¶rgy receives working papers and travels to work outside of the Jewish quarter. One day all of the Jews are pulled off of the buses leaving the Jewish quarter , and are sent to Auschwitz on a train without water. Arriving there, Georg lies about his age, unknowingly saving his own life, and tells us of camp life and the conditions he faces.
Eventually he is sent to Buchenwald , and continues on describing his life in a concentration camp, before being finally sent to another camp in Zeitz . GyÃ¶rgy falls ill and nears death, but remains alive and is eventually sent to a hospital facility in a concentration camp until the war ends. Returning to Budapest , he is confronted with those who were not sent to camps and had just recently begun to hear of the terrible injustice and suffering.
Analysis
Strong lines can also be drawn to Franz Kafka 's writings, especially The Trial . GyÃ¶rgy's justifications of all that is happening around him bears a striking resemblance of Josef K.'s eventual acceptance of his own fate. They both document severe descents into the madness of a system they are caught up in.
Movie
A movie version , screenplay by Imre KertÃ©sz , was released in 2005, made in Hungary by director Lajos Koltai, with Marcell Nagy in the starring role. It also features British actor Daniel Craig , who plays a cameo as an American Army Sergeant. [1]
