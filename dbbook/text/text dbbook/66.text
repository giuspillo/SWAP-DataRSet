First published in hard cover in April 1998 and paperback in March 1999 "Tough, Tough Toys for Tough, Tough boys" is a collection of short fiction by English author Will Self. The New York Times Book Review said of the collection... "Mr. Self's latest book, Tough, Tough Toys for Tough, Tough Boys represents his most disciplined storytelling yet. The tales in this collection demonstrate a new control and polish, without sacrificing anything in terms of inventiveness or plain weirdness. Like his 1994 novel, My Idea of Fun it attests to Mr. Self's ability to render even the most bizarre, Twilight Zone-like events with convincing verisimilitude while enthralling -- and often horrifying -- the reader with his scathing, Swiftean humor. " . " While the Washington Post considered it in slightly harsher terms... The dark devices Self relies on still bring gasps of admiration and shock, but for a successful author who has long since navigated the thicket of pubescent self-loathing there is a risk that they also serve a cynical purpose, providing cover for a failure of sustained imagination.
