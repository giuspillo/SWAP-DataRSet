The Prisoner of Zenda is an adventure novel by Anthony Hope, published in 1894. The king of the fictional country of Ruritania is drugged on the eve of his coronation and thus unable to attend the ceremony. Political forces are such that in order for the king to retain his crown his coronation must go forward. An English gentleman on holiday who fortuitously resembles the monarch, is persuaded to act as his political decoy in an attempt to save the situation. The villainous Rupert of Hentzau gave his name to the sequel published in 1898, which is included in some editions of this novel. The books were extremely popular and inspired a new genre of Ruritanian romance, including the Graustark novels by George Barr McCutcheon.

Aubrey Smith as Colonel Zapt and David Niven as Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim. David O. Selznick decided to produce the film, partly as a comment on the Edward VIII abdication crisis , [1] and it was directed by John Cromwell . Of the many film adaptations, this is considered by many to be the definitive version. [2] Leslie Halliwell puts it at No. 590 of all the films ever made, saying that the "splendid schoolboy adventure story" of the late Victorian novel is "perfectly transferred to the screen", [3] and quotes a 1971 comment by John Cutts that the film becomes more "fascinating and beguiling" as time goes by. Halliwell's Film Guide 2008 calls it "one of the most entertaining films to come out of Hollywood". [4]
Colman, Smith and Fairbanks reprised their roles for a 1939 episode of Lux Radio Theatre , with Colman's wife Benita Hume playing Princess Flavia.

In this version Sellers plays the King, his father, and the other main character Syd Frewin, a London Hansom Cab driver, who finds himself employed as a double to the King and eventually changes places with him permanently. This comic version is not strictly true to the book but has been thought by many[ weasel words ] to capture its spirit very well.

Homages
Many subsequent fictional works that feature a political decoy can be linked to The Prisoner of Zenda;[ opinion ] indeed, this novel spawned the genre known as Ruritanian romance . What follows is a short list of those homages with a clear debt to Anthony Hope's book.
The 1902 short story "Rupert the Resembler" is one of the so-called New Burlesques, a comedy parody by Bret Harte .
E. Phillips Oppenheim 's 1920 book The Great Impersonation (filmed in 1921, 1935 and 1942) makes use of the look-alike plot, this time between an English aristocrat and a German spy.
1926's The Mad King was Edgar Rice Burroughs ' version of the Ruritanian romance set in Europe immediately before and during World War I, his story differs from the Hope books in a number of details, though sharing much of their basic plot.
Dornford Yates acknowledged Hope's influence [5] in his two novels Blood Royal (1929) and Fire Below a.k.a. By Royal Command (1930) which were set in the Ruritania-like Principality of Riechtenburg.
The Magnificent Fraud (1939): a Robert Florey film starring Akim Tamiroff where an American actor impersonates the assassinated president of a South American republic.
Robert A. Heinlein adapted the Zenda plot line to his science fiction novel Double Star (1956) with great success
The 1965 comedy film The Great Race included an extended subplot that parodies Zenda, including a climactic fencing scene between Tony Curtis and Ross Martin . In the film Tony Curtis is seen doing what is only described in the 1937 The Prisoner of Zenda; he is seen swimming the moat, scaling the tower and eliminating some guards.
Two episodes of the spoof spy television series Get Smart , "The King Lives?" and "To * Sire With Love, Parts 1 and 2", parodied the 1937 movie version, with Don Adams affecting Ronald Colman 's accent.
The 1970 novel Royal Flash by George MacDonald Fraser purports to explain the real story behind The Prisoner of Zenda, and indeed, in an extended literary conceit , claims to be the inspiration for Hope's novelâ€”the narrator of the memoirs, in the framing story , tells his adventures to his lawyer, Hawkins, who can be assumed to be Anthony Hope. Otto von Bismarck and other real people such as Lola Montez are involved in the plot. It was adapted as a film of the same title in 1975, directed by Richard Lester , starring Malcolm McDowell as Flashman and Oliver Reed as Bismarck.
The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (1974) by Nicholas Meyer is a non-canonical addition to the Sherlock Holmes stories. Holmes and Watson meet Rassendyll on a train to Vienna after he has left Ruritania.
The Doctor Who serial " The Androids of Tara " (1978) had as a working title "The Androids of Zenda" and used a similar plot and setting. It featured Tom Baker as the Doctor and Mary Tamm in four roles: Romana and Princess Strella, and android doubles of each. The 1980 novelisation was by Terrance Dicks , who was script-editor on the 1984 BBC serialisation of Zenda.
The Zenda Vendetta ( TimeWars Book 4) by Simon Hawke (1985) is a science fiction version, part of a series which pits 27th century terrorists the Timekeepers against the Time Commandos of the US Army Temporal Corps. The Timekeepers kill Rassendyll so that the Time Commando Finn Delaney is sent back to impersonate the impersonator, both to ensure that history follows its true path and to defeat the terrorists. In the finale the Time Commandos assault Zenda Castle with lasers and atomic grenades, both to rescue the king and to destroy the Timekeepers base.
Moon over Parador (1988), adapted by Leon Capetanos and directed by Paul Mazursky . More directly a remake of The Magnificent Fraud , the story is set in Latin America with Richard Dreyfus as the President and as the actor Jack Noah, RaÃºl JuliÃ¡ as Roberto Strausmann (the "Black Michael" character), and Sonia Braga as Madonna Mendez (the Flavia character). It is a romantic comedy .

Like Moon Over Parador, it is a romantic comedy.
John Spurling 's novel After Zenda (1995) is a tongue-in-cheek modern adventure in which Karl, the secret great-grandson of Rudolf Rassendyll and Queen Flavia, goes to post-Communist Ruritania, where he gets mixed up with various rebels and religious sects before ending up as constitutional monarch .
The Prisoner of Zenda, Inc. , a 1996 made-for-television version, is set in the contemporary United States and revolves around a high school boy who is the heir to a large corporation.

De speelgoedzaaier, a Spike and Suzy comic by Willy Vandersteen , is loosely based on The Prisoner of Zenda.
Pale Fire , a 1962 novel by Vladimir Nabokov , includes Ruritanian elements in the (supposed?) life and events of the exiled king of "Zembla"
Sherlock Holmes and the Hentzau Affair, a 2007 novel by David Stuart Davies , is a sequel that incorporates Sherlock Holmes into the plot.
In " The Prisoner of Benda ", an episode of the animated TV series Futurama , Bender impersonates (or rather, switches bodies with) the Emperor of Robo-Hungary as part of a scheme to steal the crown jewels.
Kim Newman â€™s 2011 novel " Professor Moriarty : The Hound of the D'urbervilles" incorporates elements and characters from "The Prisoner of Zenda" into the chapter "A Shambles in Belgravia," an alternate version of the Sherlock Holmes story " A Scandal in Bohemia ", from the perspective of Colonel Sebastian Moran .
Legacy
In a popular, but very questionable account, a German circus acrobat named Otto Witte claimed he had been briefly mistaken for the new King of Albania at the time of that country's separation from the Ottoman Empire , and that he was crowned and reigned a few days. However, the date of this claim (1913), and the lack of any evidence to back it up, suggests that Witte made up his story after seeing the first film version of the novel.
Author Salman Rushdie cited The Prisoner of Zenda in the epigraph to Haroun and the Sea of Stories , the novel he wrote while living in hiding in the late 1980s.
In Pakistan in 2010, it was noted that the novel had been part of syllabus of higher secondary school for over three decades. [7]
