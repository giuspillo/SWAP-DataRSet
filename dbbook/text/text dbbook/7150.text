Plot
The story is set in the country of Opium, a strip of land between Mexico (now called AztlÃ¡n ), and the United States . Opium (country), which is essentially an opium (drug)-producing estate, is ruled by Matteo AlacrÃ¡n, also known as El PatrÃ³n. El PatrÃ³n's work-force consists of illegal immigrants whom the Farm Patrol (ex-criminals who are tempted with the offer of protection from the police) enslave when they catch them crossing the border in either direction. These illegal immigrants become "eejits", humans with computer chips implanted in their brains, making them more or less zombies who can perform only simple tasks. These "eejits" act, or cease to act, only when ordered to do so. If an eejit is not told to stop doing its simple task, it will continue until it dies.
The main character, Matt, is a clone of El PatrÃ³n, an incredibly powerful, 148-year-old drug lord who intends to take Matt's organs when his own organs fail. Matt was grown from a set of cells taken from El PatrÃ³n decades ago, then frozen. He was cultured in a test tube, then transferred into a surrogate mother when it became clear that he was going to survive. For the first six years of his life, he lives with Celia, a cook who works in El PatrÃ³n's mansion. One day, he is discovered by two children (Emilia and Steven). The next day they return, and bring Emilia's sister, MarÃ­a, who immediately captivates Matt. They observe him through the window for a while, but soon get bored and turn to leave. Matt is so worried that MarÃ­a will be eaten by a mythical creature that he smashes the window and jumps out to save her. Never having experienced pain before, he was unaware of the danger in jumping barefoot onto smashed glass. The children carry him to El PatrÃ³n's mansion to be treated. The people there treat Matt kindly until Mr. AlacrÃ¡n, El PatrÃ³n's great-grandson, recognizes him as a clone.
For the next few months, he is treated as an animal by most of the AlacrÃ¡ns, and is locked into a room filled with sawdust for his "litter". The inhabitants of the Big House, meanwhile, are so disgusted by him that they all move to different wings of the mansion, as if they are afraid of contamination. However, MarÃ­a discovers where he is being kept and informs Celia, who tells El PatrÃ³n about Matt's filthy conditions and abusive treatment. El PatrÃ³n immediately punishes the maid who was in charge of Matt, gives Matt clothes and his own room, and commands everyone to treat him with respect. Matt is also given a bodyguard, named Tam Lin, who becomes a father figure to him. Still, everyone but Celia, MarÃ­a, and Tam Lin look upon Matt with ill-disguised revulsion, only hiding it when El PatrÃ³n is around.
Matt lives in the Big House for the next seven years. He and MarÃ­a quickly become friends, and friendship gradually blossoms into romance. However, Matt is deliberately kept in the dark by everyone about his identity and purpose until a cruel joke reveals to him that he is a clone. Matt also discovers that all clones are supposed to be injected when "harvested" with a compound that cripples their brains and turns them into little more than thrashing, drooling animals. From then on, he studies and practices the piano with a vengeance, in a state of denial. In his heart, Matt already knows the reason for his existence, yet he convinces himself that El PatrÃ³n would not hire tutors for him and go to all the trouble of keeping him entertained if he were intending to kill Matt in the end, and that El PatrÃ³n must want Matt to run the country when El PatrÃ³n dies.
At Steven and Emilia's wedding, El PatrÃ³n has a near-fatal heart attack . Matt and MarÃ­a, who have by this time realized they love each other, attempt to flee in the ensuing chaos but are betrayed by Steven and Emilia. MarÃ­a is taken away, and Matt is taken to the Big House's hospital, where El PatrÃ³n at last confirms that Matt lived only to keep himself, El PatrÃ³n, alive in the end. At that moment, Celia reveals that she has been giving Matt carefully measured doses of arsenic , which, though not large enough to kill Matt, would certainly be fatal to one as frail as El PatrÃ³n; El PatrÃ³n becomes so enraged that he has another heart attack and dies. Mr. AlacrÃ¡n orders Tam Lin to dispose of Matt; Tam Lin pretends to comply, and ties him to a horse and rides away to dispose of him. But instead, he gives Matt supplies and sets him on a path to AztlÃ¡n.
Arriving in AztlÃ¡n, Matt comes across a kind of penal colony for orphans. These orphans are called the "Lost Boys", and Matt is sent to live with them by a group of men known as the "Keepers," who are fervent followers of Marxism . The Keepers operate plankton farms, forcing the orphans to do manual labor and subsist on plankton. The Keepers enjoy luxurious quarters and delectable food, claiming that this is fair because they "earned" the right to do so by working hard during their childhood.
Matt is at first an outcast because the other boys think he is a spoiled aristocrat . However, Matt becomes a hero when he defies the Keepers and leads the boys in a rebellion against them. Matt then flees with his friends among the Lost Boys. They struggle to the nearest city, San Luis, then go to the convent to find MarÃ­a and her mother, the politically powerful Esperanza.
Esperanza thanks the boys for giving her an excuse to charge the Keepers with drug trafficking: for years, everybody has known about it, but no one has had sufficient evidence for a search warrant. Matt also learns that Opium is in lockdown. He manages to re-enter the country, but only to learn that no one in the AlacrÃ¡n estate is alive, except for Celia, Daft Donald, and Mr. Ortega. Tam Lin and everyone else in the estate drank poisoned wine that El PatrÃ³n wanted to be served at his funeral. Tam Lin knew that this wine had been tainted, and decides to drink it anyway. He felt that he deserved to die... after (accidentally) killing those twenty children, so many years ago. El PatrÃ³n wanted to either run the business forever, or have it and everybody else die with him. Matt, being El PatrÃ³n's genetic heir, is the new ruler of Opium but decides to dismantle the regime.
Characters
Matt (short for Matteo) is the protagonist in this story. He is a clone of El PatrÃ³n, created so he can be used for transplants to prolong El PatrÃ³n's life when El PatrÃ³n's organs fail. Though most clones have their brains destroyed at birth, El PatrÃ³n's clones are left unharmed and live like normal human beings until El PatrÃ³n needs a transplant. Matt, with Tam Lin, Celia, and Maria's help, manages to escape the horrible fate of the 7 other clones and out-lives El PatrÃ³n, becoming the ruler of Opium.
Celia is the Big House cook and Mattâ€™s caretaker. Celia is the mother figure in Matt's life, and protects him from the abhorrent truths about his purpose.
El PatrÃ³n is a drug lord , born Matteo (he later took on the name AlacrÃ¡n, meaning scorpion ), the ruler of Opium, and eventually, the most powerful man in the world. He has lived for 148 years by harvesting organs from his clones , the last of which (and the only one who lived) was Matt. The AztlÃ¡nos call him the old vampire of Dreamland (a metonym for Opium). El PatrÃ³n is the only one protecting Matt from the people who do not like Matt, but Matt soon finds out that El Patron only wants him for his organs . El PatrÃ³n has a heart attack when Matt is 14, and demands Matt give him life in return for the life that he granted Matt. However, he is foiled by Celia. El PatrÃ³n is so enraged by her treachery that he soon has another heart attack and dies.
MarÃ­a and Emilia are the only children of Mr. Mendoza, who is an influential US Senator. El PatrÃ³n, who likes making powerful friends, frequently invites him to stay in Opium; consequently, MarÃ­a spends a lot of time in the Big House. She's around Matt's age and is his only friend, aside from Celia and Tam Lin. She treats him well even when no one else will, and unlike everyone else, doesn't see him as a filthy abomination. As they get older, they realize that they love each other. Emilia is revealed towards the end to be cruel-hearted and snobbish, showing no interest in her mother, feeling betrayed that her mother sticks up for "losers". She presumably died with her husband, Steven, during the funeral.
The Lost Boys are a group of boys whose parents were captured by the Farm Patrol while attempting to emigrate to the US, and were most likely turned into eejits. These boys are kept in Keepers' orphanage compounds in AztlÃ¡n and forced to work incessantly and adhere to Marxist principles, often punished for minor offenses, while the Keepers sit idle most of the time, secretly involved in the resale of laudanum from Opium. Ton-Ton, Chacho and Fidelito are the Lost Boys who join forces with Matt and escape the Keepers with him.
The AlacrÃ¡ns are El PatrÃ³n's descendants. They include his grandson, Gustavo AlacrÃ¡n, known to most as "El Viejo", his great-grandson Mr. AlacrÃ¡n, and his great-great grandsons, Benito, Tom, and Steven.
Mr. Mendoza is a US Senator, and his two daughters, MarÃ­a and Emilia. Mr. Mendoza is one of El PatrÃ³n's friends and visits his daughters frequently. He probably attended the funeral and died with the other mourners.
Esperanza is Mr. Mendoza's former wife, and MarÃ­a and Emilia's mother. She walked out on them when MarÃ­a was five, and is the author of "A History of Opium", a book about the atrocities of Opium. A copy of this makes its way into Matt's hands through Tam Lin. From a page in the back of the book about the author, Matt deduces that Esperanza is politically powerful. When he's escaping Opium, Tam Lin orders him to seek out MarÃ­a in order to find her mother, Esperanza, who could probably help Matt.
Rosa is a maid employed by the AlacrÃ¡n Estate, who treats Matt horribly upon discovering he is a clone. She tortures and neglects him for six months when she is finally reported to El PatrÃ³n. For this offense, she is turned into an eejit who can only fetch horses for Matt (who pities her, despite her cruel treatment of him).
Willum is the lead doctor at the AlacrÃ¡n Estate, who frequently treats Matt for sickness and injury. He has a love-hate relationship with Rosa.
El Viejo is El PatrÃ³n's grandson and Mr. AlacrÃ¡n's father. He is described by Celia as "the only good man in the house". He later dies of an unknown cause, for which a lavish funeral is held in his honor.
Felicia is the drunken, psychopathical, and often drugged wife of Mr. AlacrÃ¡n. She ran off with fellow opium farmer Mr. MacGregor, and comes home with a son, Tom, as a result. As Tom grows up, the two continuously plot Matt's downfall.
Tom is a rude, mean-spirited boy who is detested (with varying degrees of openness) by almost everyone at the AlacrÃ¡n Estate. He has specific animosity towards Matt, whom he and Felicia frequently try to bring down.
Benito is one of Mr. AlacrÃ¡n's children. He is described by Matt as "slightly nicer" than Steven and Emilia, which more or less proves to be true.
Fani is Benito's wife. She detests her husband, but was drugged and forced to marry him by El PatrÃ³n. She frequently drinks as a form of escapism. She may have been at the funeral and died, or could have possibly left Benito the moment his great-great-grandfather died, as she hated him and El PatrÃ³n's power no longer held over her, and she wouldn't have to leave Nigeria.
Felipe is El PatrÃ³n's son, who has died long before the time of the story's premise.
Mr. MacGregor is a drug lord in Opium and El PatrÃ³n's apparent best friend. He also invokes the use of a clone for organs, much to the shock of Matt and MarÃ­a.He is also Tom's biological father.
Sister InÃ©z is a nun at the Covenant of Santa Clara, where MarÃ­a and Emilia attend school.
Jorge, Raul, and Carlos are Keepers in Aztlan, who frequently mistreat the Lost Boys while they themselves enjoy lavish parties and the use of laudanum, a drug similar to heroin .
Furball is Maria's dog, who is later poisoned with laudanum by Felicia to frame Matt.
Eejits are mostly illegal immigrants who have been caught by El Patron when they are sneaking through Opium. They have computer chips inserted into their brains, which turns them into mindless, emotionless slaves. They are used to do simple tasks within the mansion and to harvest opium. Though most are captured illegal immigrants, some are people who angered El PatrÃ³n, such as Rosa, the maid who locked Matt in a room with sawdust and treated him brutally.
Tam Lin is Matt's bodyguard and father figure. El Patron gives Matt a choice between Tam Lin and Daft Donald, his other bodyguard; Matt sees a "glint of friendliness" in Tam Lin's eyes and chooses him. Matt quickly bonds with Tam Lin, who teaches Matt to climb treacherous rock-faces and live for days in the wild. He is also one of the only people who believes what Matt says about Tom. Tam Lin is later called back to El PatrÃ³n's side and leaves Matt with a cache of supplies in the hopes that when El PatrÃ³n decides to take Matt's heart for his own, Matt will escape over the nearby mountains into AztlÃ¡n to seek out the convent of Santa Clara where MarÃ­a lives and attends school. All of El PatrÃ³n's bodyguards are wanted criminals, and Tam Lin is no exception: he was a Scottish nationalist who laid a bomb for the British Prime Minister that accidentally killed a bus full of 20 children instead. As atonement, he drinks wine he knows El PatrÃ³n poisoned, along with all of the other AlacrÃ¡ns.
Daft Donald is a mute bodyguard who works for El Patron. He cannot speak because his vocal cords and throat were damaged in Tam Lin's terrorist mission. He was Tam Lin's accomplice in Tam Lin's little stunt as a terrorist. During El PatrÃ³n's wake, when the poisoned wine is brought out, Tam Lin tells Daft Donald not to drink. Obviously, everyone dies but him, and he seals the burial chamber off with a dynamite explosion. Daft Donald is the one who informs Matt what happened to everybody when Matt returns to the Big House. He can communicate with others through the use of a laptop.
Keepers are the adult workers who watch over the Lost Boys. Most are mean and cruel to the Lost Boys.
Fidelito A skinny child also kept in hand of the Keepers, Matt's friend who helps him escape.
Chacho- Another friend who helps Matt escape, Chacho is Matt's best friend in the plankton factory.
Ton-Ton is a stuttering but dedicated Lost Boy who becomes very valuable to Matt in his attempt to escape the Keepers and resolve the crisis in Opium.
Flaco is another Lost Boy in the Keepers' care, and the oldest in the plankton factory.
Mr. Ortega is Matt's (ironically) deaf music teacher.
Steven is one of Mr. Alacran's children. He turns out to be evil in the end. He is Emilia's husband and dies in the end.
United States
The United States has lost much of its former glory and, at the very least, its southwest region has been reduced to poverty and " Third World " status. El PatrÃ³n claims that just as many people try to run to AztlÃ¡n from the United States as the other way around. It is mentioned briefly that Ireland is now one of the richest countries in the world, effectively usurping US prestige as one of the world's wealthiest nations.
AztlÃ¡n
Formerly known as Mexico , AztlÃ¡n lies south of the border region. As evidenced by conditions in one of the major cities, San Luis, parts of AztlÃ¡n are very affluent, while others, such as Durango , the region that El PatrÃ³n and Celia hail from, languish in poverty. While many residents of AztlÃ¡n still try to cross Opium and get to the United States, a similar number of US immigrants try to enter AztlÃ¡n illegally. Certain regions along the coast of the Gulf of California in AztlÃ¡n are desertified , and what remains of the Colorado River has become highly polluted.
Opium
A strip of large poppy "farms," or plantations, wedged between the United States and AztlÃ¡n on a narrow strip of land, and governed and presided over by drug lords, most prominently El PatrÃ³n, Opium takes its name from the drug cultivated there . Employing an army mostly of mercenaries , known as the "Farm Patrol," and tended by "eejits," or mindless zombie -like slaves with computer chips installed in their heads to make them docile and subservient, Opium can best be described as a dystopian narco-state ruled by an oligarchy of certain aristocratic families, like El PatrÃ³n's family, the AlacrÃ¡ns. Though many illegal immigrants try to cross its vast, mountainous terrain as a means of reaching either AztlÃ¡n or the USA, several find themselves abducted by the Farm Patrol and turned into eejits, with very rare exceptions, such as Celia, who's employed by El PatrÃ³n and the AlacrÃ¡ns. Nancy Farmer says that the main setting of the story is in the vicinity of the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona .
Plankton Factory
The plankton factory is near San Luis in AztlÃ¡n, in the desert left where the Gulf of California has dried up. It is a forced labor camp run by the "Keepers" on collectivist, Marxist principles for all of the orphans, or "Lost Boys," of the territory, where plankton is harvested as a food source for the world's increasing population. After escaping the Farm Patrol and being rescued by the Keepers, Matt is held at the factory by the Keepers after he is transferred there from the original camp along the border with Opium. There, he and several of his fellow inmates are subjected to physical beatings and psychological torture if they dare to challenge the system in any way, and Matt is described by the Keepers as an "aristocrat" for trying to incite dissent and imbuing his fellow orphans with ideas that don't fall in line with the Keepers' way of thinking. Later, he plans a rebellion to save both himself and the other Lost Boys, but his plans only come to fruition after he is forced to spend the night in the "boneyard," a massive graveyard consisting of the skeletal remains of beached whales that have formed sinkholes, which lies near the factory's outermost perimeter.
San Luis
A large city, San Luis boasts a mostly affluent population, and is indicated to be a major cultural center in AztlÃ¡n. It is the location of the convent school that the Mendoza girls attend, and the Keepers' plankton factory is located about 5â€“10 miles outside the city limits. Matt, Chacho, Fidelito and Ton-Ton later venture to San Luis in search of the convent where Tam Lin told Matt he would find MarÃ­a, arriving in the midst of the Dia de los Muertos festivities. However, they are confronted by the Keepers. Fortunately, the intervention of the nuns and MarÃ­a's powerful mother, Esperanza Mendoza, saves the boys from being taken away by the Keepers, and, subsequently, after Matt sees MarÃ­a, Esperanza recruits him to undertake the task of breaching Opium's security and gaining control of the country.
