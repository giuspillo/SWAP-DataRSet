Plot summary
Fresh from his trip to Britannia , Marcus Didius Falco needs to re-establish himself back in Rome. A minor role in the trial of a senator entangles him in the machinations of two lawyers: Silus Italicus and Paccius Africanus, both ex- consuls with notorious reputations.
The senator is convicted, but then dies, apparently by suicide. Silius hires Falco and his young associates - Aelianus and Justinus - to prove that it was murder, not an attempt to protect his heirs from further legal action. However, probing this tangle of upper-class secrets leads to fresh prosecutions. Falco finds himself in the role of advocate, exposing himself to powerful elements in Roman law . If he offends the wrong people, it might lead to charges he has not bargained for and ruin his family financially.
