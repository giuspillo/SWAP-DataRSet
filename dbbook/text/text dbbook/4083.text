Christopher and His Kind is a memoir published in 1976 by British author Christopher Isherwood , who narrates the actual events and experiences of his life between 1929 and 1939, covering, among other things, his Berlin years - the source of inspiration for some of his most famous novels, such as Goodbye to Berlin . [1]
Isherwood decided late in his life that he had a moral obligation to renounce the self-censorship he'd wrung around his Berlin novels, specifically the excision of any hint of his homosexuality.
In the book, Isherwood recounts his life experiences as a young gay man enticed by the liberated atmosphere of Weimar Berlin into a quest for sexual and intellectual emancipation, and argues that his homosexuality, far from marginal private shame to be suppressed, was a central element in his human and creative development, an identity he cherished and shared with many others ("my tribe", "my kind") with whom he felt a special kinship. This remarkably candid autobiography was, in Isherwood's view, the way to discharge an obligation he felt due to "his kind", i.e. his contribution to the gay liberation cause.
