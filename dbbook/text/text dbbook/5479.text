Plot summary
The book is structured around a story of three people in their late 20s visiting Roy, the title character, for lessons in financial planning. Each chapter of the book describes a different visit and a different element of financial planning. Each month along with their lessons the three students are required to start carrying out the actions prescribed by Roy. In addition to these individuals, Roy also shares his financial knowledge with the customers of his barber shop.
The story is set primarily in Sarnia, Ontario , where Roy has been operating a barber shop for several decades. As a young man, Roy had planned to become a lawyer, but those plans are derailed. He ends up taking over his father's barber shop. Worried about money, Roy visits Mr. White, one of the town's wealthiest men, and asks for advice on financial planning. This advice paves the way for Roy's accumulating wealth.
The basis of the book is Roy's advice to "save 10 per cent of all that you earn and invest it for long-term growth." In that, it draws from the advice first set forth in The Richest Man in Babylon . Subsequent chapters discuss wills and life insurance, RRSPs , buying a home, income tax and saving and spending.
Roy (and thus Chilton) is not as harshly anti-debt as some other authors, like Dave Ramsey . However Roy does advise that extra money should go to pay off debt, and that credit cards are " anathema " to well-run personal finances. Roy does believe that if you are investing 10% and maxing out your RRSP, day-to-day spending doesn't matter too much to your overall financial picture.

Plot summary
This novel is formatted differently than the first; Chilton speaks through his own voice instead of fictional characters. The novel is divided into 54 short chapters which are roughly 2-3 pages each making it easy to read and enjoyable for all ages. Each chapter is devoted to a different money lesson such as; lines of credit, credit cards, retirement saving plans and tax free savings plans. A large focus in the sequel is on reckless spending behaviour and consumption. [2] [3]
Five Essential Lessons
1. Remove Temptation Triggers
Our brains have become wired to emotional excitement gained by temptations and consumption. By avoiding these temptations and emotional excitement you lower your chances of over spending. For example, if your weakness is shopping for clothing, remove the temptation; stop going to the mall unnecessarily and reading fashion blogs.
2. Banks Are A Business
Contrary to what we believe, banks are not looking out for its customer's best interest. A bank's goal is to gain as much money as possible for themselves and their shareholders.
3. Credit Cards Are Evil
Credit cards carry extremely high interests rates on unpaid monthly balance and even if you are able to pay off your balance, it still encourages you to overspend. In addition credit cards make us less sensitive to the cost of our purchases and ignorant to our spending. Chilton stresses the importance of being in control of your debt and being debt free by the time you are ready for retirement.
4. You Can Not Have Everything
Millionaires cannot even afford everything they desire. Identify where your money is going by reviewing your credit card statements and bank account summaries. Try indulging in one or two area of interest, for example travel, a particular sport or other interest and cut spending elsewhere.
5. Wealth Flows From Savings
Wealth depends more on savings than income. Chilton's bottom line, which is emphasized in his first book as well, is that we should all save 10-15% of our earnings. [4] [5]
