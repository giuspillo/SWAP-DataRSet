Crown of Stars is a short story collection by James Tiptree, Jr. that was first published in 1988. All but one of the stories ("Come Live With Me") had previously appeared elsewhere in Science fiction magazines or anthologies.
Contents
"Second Going" (1987)
The first two stories in Crown of Stars: â€œSecond Goingâ€� and â€œOur Resident Djinn â€� are about God , gods , and the death of God . â€œSecond Goingâ€� is the collectionâ€™s centerpiece, a true science fiction classic. Narrated as a documentary from NASA â€™s chief archivist , we learn of humanityâ€™s First Contact . Interstellar-wandering, telepathic aliens contact Earth after we launch our first manned mission to Mars , stating that they will meet with the astronauts once they arrive. The Angli (large, blue cephalopods ) turn out to be benevolent, if technologically simple, space tourists. They are interested in spending several months exploring Earth, then moving on. They are puzzled, though, by the lack of living gods on Earth; which exist on every other planet they have visited. [1]
"Our Resident Djinn" (1986)
"Our Resident Djinn ," on the other hand, opens cold with the death of God. Satan has just gotten the news of his rival's death from an angelic messenger and decides the best thing would be for him to fly up to the heavenly kingdom to pay his last respects to his old adversary . St. Peter gives Satan a tour of the empty capitol, which is to be sold off piecemeal in a sort of divine Chapter 7 Bankruptcy . The story is satirical and a good romp. The ending is somewhat disturbing (a sudden cloud over the oddly light tone of the story), which makes ominously foreshadows the dark, depressing tone of later entries.
"Morality Meat" (1985, credited to Raccoona Sheldon )
The next two stories, â€œMorality Meat,â€� and â€œAll This and Heaven Too,â€� illustrate some of the unevenness of this anthology. â€œMorality Meat,â€� is easily the third best story here and a pure, white-knuckle science fiction horror story. Itâ€™s also the most unabashedly feminist story, by a mile. This work makes Animal Farm look coy and subtle. Basically, this is the tale of a 16-year-old black girl living in a right-wing, dystopian future California. After being raped, she has no choice but to become a single mother, since abortions are illegal. She is forced to give her baby up for adoption , since she cannot afford to feed two. The story is incredibly dark, grotesque , and political .
"All This and Heaven Too" (1985)
â€œAll This and Heaven Too,â€� on the other hand, is a pleasant tale about young lovers, fairy-tale geopolitics, and ridiculous court intrigue. Set in a happy, utopian kingdom and an adjacent polluted, industrial kingdom, the principalitiesâ€™ heirs fall in love. Placed after the taut horror of â€œMorality Meat,â€� this stands out as a cheesy fantasy . [1]
"Yanqui Doodle" (1987)
â€œYanqui Doodle,â€� is the fifth story and is another highly political work. The US is fighting a full-fledged war in Latin-America and the Congressional Armed Services Committee is on a tour of the front and will soon stop at a field hospital to visit the wounded. Soldiers are encouraged to take government-issued drugs (mainly amphetamines ) to become remorseless killing machines. A soldier is recovering from a landmine explosion in this field hospital and it quickly becomes clear that drug withdrawal is a far more serious concern than his wounds. This is also a horror story, although more psychological . It is clearly influenced by Sheldon's work in the CIA and her personal addiction to amphetamines. [1]
"Come Live with Me" (1988)
The sixth story, "Come Live With Me," is one of the last stories written by Tiptree. It is the only story in this collection regarding the far future and deep space. It's a quick, simple tale of a deep-space exploration crew's encounter with a mind-controlling   lily , mainly from the plant's perspective. The plant has never encountered a being more intelligent than a space beaver , so meeting humans and their egos is a big change. [1]
"Last Night and Every Night" (1970)
"In Midst of Life" (1987)
â€œLast Night and Every Night,â€� and â€œ In the Midst of Life,â€� are weaker entries. Both are about humans who are transformed into Deathâ€™s servants. They are short, feature little action, and lack sympathetic characters. [1]
"Backward, Turn Backward" (1988)'
â€œBackward, Turn Backward,â€� is very disturbing. Itâ€™s another horror story, although not as outright scary as the other two, but the meaning and context is stomach-turning. The story is the tale of a riches-to-rags schoolgirl, Diane, who ends up murdering Don, the boy who saves her from prostitution and makes her happy, (though he is unable give her everything she always wanted) by shooting him in the back as they lay in bed. This also kills her due to time travel . A few months after this was written, Alice Sheldon shot her husband, then herself, in their bed . [3] It is perhaps the most painful of all of Sheldon's pain-filled stories to read, not only because it foreshadows the circumstances of her own death, but also because it contains poignant and passionate imagery of heterosexual love, only to violently renounce these themes at the end. Ultimately, "Backward" judges Diane harshly: the timeline resulting from her murder condemning her to a long, painful life as prostitute, before being immolated by teens for sport. The story lends credence to the theory that Sheldon murdered her husband and that it was not really a willing double-suicide, as is commonly believed. [1] [4]
"The Earth Doth Like a Snake Renew" (1988) [Written in 1973 by Raccoona Sheldon]
"The Earth Doth Like a Snake Renew," is a reversal of the earlier Tiptree story, "The Last Flight of Doctor Ain," her first widely-acclaimed piece. [5] In this story, the Earth is male and the main character is a young woman named "P." P is in love with the Earth and obsessively desires to find a way to physically consummate that love. She is also a submissive masochist . The relationship between the two is portrayed as abusive , with the Earth harming and manipulating the protagonist, while simultaneously providing for her. Ultimately, the Earth is shown to not truly love her, but, rather, to love another planetoid . This planetoid crashes into the Earth, knocking it off its orbit and killing all life, including P. Just as the love was one directional, so was the power. [1] [6]
