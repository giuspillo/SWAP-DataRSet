The Homecoming is a two-act play written in 1964 by Nobel laureate Harold Pinter and it was first published in 1965. The original Broadway production won the 1967 Tony Award for Best Play and its 40th-anniversary Broadway production at the Cort Theatre was nominated for a 2008 Tony Award for "Best Revival of a Play". Set in North London, the play has six characters. Five of these are men who are related to each other: Max, a retired butcher; his brother Sam, a chauffeur; and Max's three sons – Teddy, an expatriate American philosophy professor; Lenny, who appears to be a pimp; and Joey, a would-be boxer in training who works in demolition. There is one woman, Ruth, who is Teddy's wife. The play concerns Teddy's and Ruth's "homecoming," which has distinctly different symbolic and thematic implications. Considering the play while surveying Pinter's career on the occasion of its 40-anniversary production at the Cort Theatre, in The New Yorker, the critic John Lahr wrote, Template:"'The Homecoming' changed my life. Before the play, I thought words were just vessels of meaning; after it, I saw them as weapons of defense. Before, I thought theatre was about the spoken; after, I understood the eloquence of the unspoken. The position of a chair, the length of a pause, the choice of a gesture, I realized, could convey volumes."
The characters who appear onstage are as follows:
Max, 70 - The patriarch of the family.
Lenny, early 30s - Max's son.
Sam, 63 - Max's brother.
Joey, a boxer, middle 20s - Max's son.
Teddy, middle 30s - Max's son.
Ruth, early 30s - Teddy's wife.
Symbolism and irony of title
In addition to the play being about Teddy's "homecoming," its ending suggests that another symbolic homecoming on a variety of levels is Ruth's. Symbolically, Ruth comes "home" to "herself" (rediscovers her previous identity prior to her marriage to Teddy) [2] and to this woman-less (motherless, wifeless, sister-in-lawless) family (Max, Lenny, Joey, and Sam), ironically, in the process, rendering her own family with Teddy similarly without (mother, wife, woman). [3]
By the end of the play, Ruth appears to have assumed the multiple roles of Jessie, the London family's missing wife and mother, the missing woman in their household ("mother/wife/whore"), while putting the American family of Ruth and Teddy in a parallel position, reversing the situation at the beginning of the play. [3] In that sense, the play recalls Edward's reversal of roles with the silent Matchseller in Pinter's 1959 play A Slight Ache , initially broadcast on BBC Radio 3 , and similarly ironic plot and character role-reversals resulting from power struggles throughout many of Pinter's other plays (Merritt, Pinter in Play 101; Batty, About Pinter 39â€“41).
For many critics the missing wall in the house, "removed" after Jessie's death, symbolises the absent female influence. [4] [5] After Teddy "comes home" with his wife, Ruth, Max invites her to remain in London. She agrees, in effect, to "come home" as the family's missing mother figure and possibly also a prostitute whom Lenny can pimp, hence filling in the gap created when "their mother died": "I've never had a whore under this roof before. Ever since your mother died" (58). Upon first seeing Ruth, Max believes that his eldest son, Teddy, has brought a "filthy scrubber" (like Jessie) into "my house" (57â€“58). A major irony of the play is that Max's apparent mistaken first assumption comes to appear accurate as they (and the audience) get to "know" Ruth better (65â€“76). [6]
Pinter's "Homecoming" is considered[ by whom? ] to be one of the best plays in Absurdist Theatre as it has been revived many times since its first premiere in London.

(December 2011)
A highly ambiguous, enigmatic, and (for some) even cryptic play, The Homecoming has been the subject of extensive critical debate for over forty years. [7] According to many critics, it exposes issues of sex and violence in a highly realistic yet aesthetically stylized manner.
Brantley and other contemporary critics now often regard as "perfection" the two-act plot structure of The Homecoming. But, in the 1960s, the play's earliest critics complained that it (like Pinter's other plays) was "plotless", as well as "meaningless" and "emotionless" (lacking character motivation), finding the play "puzzling" and not "understanding" that it might have a multiplicity of potential "meanings". [8]
Lahr considers The Homecoming to be
the last and best play of Pinter's fecund early period (1957â€“65). It is a culmination of the poetic ambiguities, the minimalism, and the linguistic tropes of his earlier major plays: " The Birthday Party " (1958), whose first production lasted only a week in London, though the play was seen by eleven million people when it was broadcast on TV in 1960, and " The Caretaker " (1960), an immediate international hit. "The Homecoming" is both a family romance and a turf war . ("Demolition Man")
The Homecoming directly challenges the place of "morals" in family life and puts their social value "under erasure" (in Derridean terms). Teddy's profession as an academic philosopher, which, he claims, enables him to "maintain . . . intellectual equilibrium"â€”
I'm the one who can see. That's why I write my critical works. [...] I can see what you do. It's the same as I do. But you're lost in it. You won't get me being . . . I won't be lost in it. (77â€“78)â€”
ironically raises basic philosophical questions about the nature of so-called "family values" and the "meaning" of "love" among family members (Lahr, Casebook; Merritt, Pinter in Play 90, 95â€“96, 194â€“96).
Occasionally, one finds critics of the play, aware of Pinter's reputation for ambiguity, questioning even Teddy's and Ruth's references to the fact of their "being married"; e.g., Sir Harold Hobson , as cited by Merritt (Pinter in Play 221â€“25): "Hobson's interpretation of Teddy as merely pretending to be Ruth's husband and a professor of philosophy enables him to rationalize the man's behavior toward his wife"; basing her viewpoint on a personal interview with Hobson, Merritt considers Hobson's review of the first production of the play, entitled "Pinter Minus the Moral", concluding: "although Hobson still describes The Homecoming as Pinter's 'cleverest play,' his judgment against the play's 'moral vacuum,' like his denial of Teddy and Ruth's marriage, suggests his personal distress at the portrayal of marriage and what Pinter has called the characters' misdirected 'love.' " (224). To deny that Teddy and Ruth are really married is a common refrain in responses to the play. Aside from their behavior in the play and that of Teddy's father and brothers toward them, nothing else in the text contradicts Teddy's and Ruth's claims that they are married and that they have three sons. The more outrageous Ruth's and his family's actions, the more Teddy protests that they are married, leading some critics to believe that the man doth protest too much , though perhaps they may do so too (Merritt, Pinter in Play 221â€“25). [8]
Continuing denial of the facts of Teddy's and Ruth's marriage and family may serve critics as a means of expressing their own rejection of what occurs in the play. [8] Alluding indirectly to this critical pattern, Brantley observes, however, that, in time, the play may appear more realistic and more relevant to the lives of theater audiences than it may have seemed when they themselves were younger or more naive about the nature of marriage and family life. To those with strong religious values, like Hobson, the play appears immoral. Yet, to others, its moral value resides in its very questioning of commonly accepted shibboleths about marriage and the family: "People who were originally put off by 'The Homecoming' may now find it too close to home. It's a bit like Picasso 's shockingly severe painting of Gertrude Stein from 1906, the one he predicted in time would resemble its subject. We may not have thought we saw ourselves in 'The Homecoming' four decades ago. Now it feels like a mirror" (Brantley, "Theater Review: The Homecoming [Cort Theater]": E7). Other critics, like Lahr, remind their readers of the strong element of comedy in this play, as in many of Pinter's other plays ("Demolition Man").
Composition history
Pinter's home in Ambrose Place, Worthing, where he wrote The Homecoming
Pinter wrote The Homecoming in six weeks in 1964 from his home in the Sussex coastal town of Worthing , where according to theatre critic John Lahr , "the magnificent barrenness of the playâ€™s North London setting was imagined as he sat at his writing desk overlooking gardens, within earshot of the sea." Pinter remarked that "it kind of wrote itself". [9]
Pinter's close friend and former schoolteacher, Joseph Brearley, was visiting Pinter after he had written the play. â€œI gave him the play to read,â€� Pinter recalled. â€œI waited in another room. About two hours later, I heard the front door slam. I thought, Well, here we are. He doesnâ€™t like it. About an hour later, the doorbell rang. I answered it. He said, â€˜I had to get some air.â€™ He said, â€˜It is your best.â€™ â€� [9]
Productions of the play have won major theater awards. For example, the 1967 New York production received four Tony Awards : the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play ( Paul Rogers ), the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Play ( Ian Holm ), the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play ( Peter Hall ), and the Tony Award for Best Play ( Alexander H. Cohen , prod.). A film of the play, also entitled The Homecoming and also directed by Peter Hall, was released in 1973; part of the two-season subscription series American Film Theatre in the United States, it is available on both VHS and DVD and distributed by Kino on Video ("Collection Two" [DVD box set]).
