This story starts out in Norwood, Virginia. Itâ€™s a quiet town with an amazing tennis team that the main character April is the star player on. The Corrigan family has a large house and they are pretty wealthy. In Aprilâ€™s room she has a lot of antique furniture and has a crystal in her window that shines rainbows across the room. Eventually her family moves to Grovewood, Florida. Itâ€™s a very sleepy town with only a few stores that are all around the same block. The family thinks that itâ€™s too hot and they donâ€™t like the new house because itâ€™s old and worn down and they canâ€™t use their money to fix it. Aprilâ€™s room now is tiny and dirty and has cracks in her ceiling that look like spider webs. April Corrigan is a 17-year-old girl who is an amazing tennis player with long blonde hair and is referred to as "Princess April". She is generally very spoiled and almost always gets what she wants. She is also very stubborn and does not listen to anyone. Then her life later flips upside down and her name is changed to Valerie Webber and she has to get her hair, that she has been growing out for so long, cut sloppily by a hurried agent and so now it is short and choppy and ugly. Her father, Jeff Corrigan, works undercover at an airport and busts a big time drug dealer who sends a hitman after him and his family. He is tall with dark hair and green eyes. He is married to Liz and has two children, April and Bram. Jim Peterson is the familyâ€™s first bodyguard. He lives with them for a few months in a hotel, until his arthritis prevents him from pulling his gun and is shot dead by the hitman, Mike Vamp. Mike Vamp is a wanted hitman with completely black eyes who is rumored to follow the scent of blood. Bram is about 6 years old, very hyper, and has one brown eye and one blue one. He is also very stubborn. Liz, their mother, is a writer who upon moving cannot write anymore so she takes up drinking and starts to do nothing but write and fight with her husband. Jeff Corrigan (who has been secretly been working for the F.B.I.) is tracked for being a witness of a drug smuggling case and he testifies against the Dealer. After he was almost shot, April and her family must relocate and switch identities to keep safe from the hitman. April must leave her perfect life- her boyfriend Steve, her close friends, and her great reputation on the school tennis team. Dreading the move, they travel to Greenwood, Florida- a â€œhick townâ€� with no income for the family besides a film developing business, Quick Pic, which is a dying business. There she does meet new people, but soon realizes that she cannot seem to keep her cover any longer. She slips up a few times and runs away to her grandma, who got attacked by Mike Vamp who was trying to get information from her. He broke her arm.. They come back and on their arrival they are attacked again at their new house but this time they fight him off and he hits his head and passes out in the ditch, drowning. The solution to this conflict is that April and Bram outsmart Mike and get out of the closet they were trapped in. They fight him out in the driveway in the pouring rain, so the ditch is full of water. April pushes him and he hits his head on the car and then tumbles into the ditch, passed out. He drowns and they relocate them again, where they all follow the rules this time.
