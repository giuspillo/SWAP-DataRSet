The Collected Stories of Katherine Anne Porter is a book published by Harcourt in 1965, comprising nineteen "short stories and long stories", as she would say. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. Collected Stories contains all the works previously collected in Flowering Judas; Pale Horse, Pale Rider; and The Leaning Tower. In the preface "Go Little Book ... ", Porter abjured the word "novella", calling it a "slack, boneless, affected word that we do not need to describe anything. " She went on to say "Please call my works by their right names: we have four that cover every division: short stories, long stories, short novels, novels."
