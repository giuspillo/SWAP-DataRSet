Lipstick Jungle is a novel written by New York writer and socialite Candace Bushnell, that weaves the stories of Nico Reilly, Wendy Healy, and Victory Ford, who are numbers 8, 12, and 17 on the New York Post's list of New York's 50 Most Powerful Women. The premise appears to tread similar ground to Bushnell's famed Sex and the City, following the lives of three New York career women; however, in this book the women are a little older, richer, and more powerful.
