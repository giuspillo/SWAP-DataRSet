Plot
It is Valentine's Day , and Spider-Man describes himself as feeling " blue ". Gwen Stacy , one of Parker's true loves, died a while ago, but he still feels blue for her to this day. So, Spider-Man recounts into a tape recorder how Gwen and he fell in love.
The series then recounts the events from The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 1 #43-48 and #63, though it switches time order and implies that Kraven the Hunter , who appeared in #47, is behind all of the villains who attack Spider-Man. It retells Peter standing between Gwen and Mary Jane Watson , berated by his friend Harry Osborn .
In the end, it is Valentine's Day, and Gwen asks Peter to be her valentine. Peter states how her death has scarred him. Her one-time rival Mary Jane taught Peter to love again, but he reveals how much he misses Gwen. Suddenly, he notices his wife Mary Jane listening. Instead of being angry, Mary Jane feels deep sympathy for her husband and tells Peter to say hello to Gwen for her and to tell her how much she misses her, too. On this note, the story ends.
