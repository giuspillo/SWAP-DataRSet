Plot
The two novellas are set in Berlin in 1931, just as Adolf Hitler was moving into power. Berlin is portrayed by Isherwood during this transition period of cafes and quaint avenues, grotesque nightlife and dreamers, and powerful mobs and millionaires.
The Berlin Stories was the starting point for the John Van Druten play I Am a Camera , which in turn went on to inspire the film I Am a Camera as well as the stage musical and film versions of Cabaret.
The character Sally Bowles is probably the best-known character from The Berlin Stories because of her later starring role in the Cabaret musical and film, although in The Berlin Stories, she is only the main character of one short story in Goodbye to Berlin .
