Future Shock is a book written by the futurist Alvin Toffler in 1970. In the book, Toffler defines the term "future shock" as a certain psychological state of individuals and entire societies. His shortest definition for the term is a personal perception of "too much change in too short a period of time". The book, which became an international bestseller, grew out of an article "The Future as a Way of Life" in Horizon magazine, Summer 1965 issue. The book has sold over 6 million copies and has been widely translated. A documentary film based on the book was released in 1972 with Orson Welles as on-screen narrator.
Term
Toffler argued that society is undergoing an enormous structural change, a revolution from an industrial society to a " super-industrial society ". This change overwhelms people. He believed the accelerated rate of technological and social change left people disconnected and suffering from "shattering stress and disorientation"â€”future shocked. Toffler stated that the majority of social problems are symptoms of future shock. In his discussion of the components of such shock, he popularized the term " information overload ."
His analysis of the phenomenon of information overload is continued in his later publications, especially The Third Wave and Powershift .
In the introduction to an essay entitled "Future Shlock" in his book, Conscientious Objections, Neil Postman wrote:
"Sometime about the middle of 1963, my colleague Charles Weingartner and I delivered in tandem an address to the National Council of Teachers of English . In that address we used the phrase "future shock" as a way of describing the social paralysis induced by rapid technological change. To my knowledge, Weingartner and I were the first people ever to use it in a public forum. Of course, neither Weingartner nor I had the brains to write a book called Future Shock, and all due credit goes to Alvin Toffler for having recognized a good phrase when one came along" (p. 162).
Development of society and production
Alvin Toffler distinguished three stages in development of society and production: Agrarian, Industrial and Post-industrial.
The first stage began in the period of the Neolithic Era when people invented agriculture therefore people passed from barbarity to a civilization . The second stage began in England with the Industrial Revolution where people invented the machine tool and the steam engine . The third stage began in the second half of the 20th century in the West where people invented automatic production, robotics and the computer . Services sector received the great value.
Toffler proposed one criterion for distinguishing between industrial society and post-industrial society . This criterion is the share of the population occupied in agriculture and the share of city labor occupied in a services sector. The share of the people occupied in agriculture doesn't exceed 15%, and the share of the people occupied in a services sector, exceeds 50% from city labor in post-industrial society. Thus, the share of the people occupied with brainwork exceeds a share of the people occupied with physical work in post-industrial society.
Fear of the future
Midtown Manhattan in New York City, the largest central business district in the United States
Alvin Toffler's main thought consists of the fact that the modern man feels shock from rapid changes. For example, Toffler's daughter went to shop in New York and she couldn't find the shop in its previous location. Thus New York has become a city without a history . The urban population doubles every 11 years. The overall production of goods and services doubles each 50 years in developed countries. Current events announce an increasing number of changes with an increasing rapidity, while people are losing the familiarity that old institutions ( religion , family , national identity , profession ) once provided. The so-called " brain drain " - emigration of European scientists to the United States is both an indicator of the changes in society and also one of its causes.
Features of post-industrial society
A generic, disposable lighter.
â€¢ Many goods have become disposable as the cost of manual repair or cleaning has become more expensive than the cost of making new goods due to Mass production . Examples of disposable goods: ballpoint pen , lighter , plastic bottles , and rockets .
â€¢ The design of goods is outdated quickly. (And so a second generation of computers appears before the end of the expected period of usability of the first generation). It is possible to rent almost everything (from a ladder to a wedding dress), thus eliminating the need of ownership.
â€¢ Whole branches of industry die off and new branches of industry arise. This impacts unskilled workers who are compelled to change their residence to find new jobs. The constant change in the market also poses a problem for advertisers who must deal with moving targets.
â€¢ People of post-industrial society change a profession and a work place often. People have to change professions because professions quickly become outdated. People of post-industrial society thus have many careers in a lifetime. The knowledge of an engineer becomes outdated in ten years. People look more and more for temporary jobs.
â€¢ To follow transient jobs, people have become nomads . For example, immigrants from Algeria , Turkey and other countries go to Europe to find work. Transient people are forced to change residence, phone number, school , friends, car license, and contact with family often. As a result, relationships tend to be superficial with a large number of people instead of intimate or close relationships that are more stable. Evidence for this is tourist travel and holiday romances.
â€¢ The driver's license , received at age 16, has become the teenager 's admission to the world of adults, because it symbolizes the ability to move independently.
