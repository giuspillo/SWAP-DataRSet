Daniel and Miranda Hilliard are separated, and Miranda, a successful businesswoman, severely limits the amount of time her husband, an impractical, out-of-work actor , is allowed to spend with their three children. When Miranda decides to hire a nanny , however, Daniel disguises himself as a woman and gets the job. The two eldest children immediately know who "Madame Doubtfire" is, but the youngest and Miranda are fooled. Daniel uses his disguise to spend time with his children. Miranda comments that the house has never been run better.
After Miranda discovers Daniel's secret â€” and after one more terrible fight â€” both parents admit to mistakes and make arrangements for Daniel to see his children more often. [1]
