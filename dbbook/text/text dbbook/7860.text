Elective Affinities, also translated under the title Kindred by Choice, is the third novel by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, published in 1809. The title is taken from a scientific term once used to describe the tendency of chemical species to combine with certain substances or species in preference to others. The novel is based on the metaphor of human passions being governed or regulated by the laws of chemical affinity, and examines whether or not the science and laws of chemistry undermine or uphold the institution of marriage, as well as other human social relations.
Theme
The book is situated around the city of Weimar . Goetheâ€™s main characters are Eduard and Charlotte, an aristocratic couple both in their second marriage, enjoying an idyllic but semi-dull life on the grounds of their rural estate. They invite the Captain, Eduardâ€™s childhood friend, and Ottilie, the beautiful, orphaned, coming-of-age niece of Charlotte, to live with them. The decision to invite Ottilie and the Captain is described as an "experiment" and this is exactly what it is. The house and its surrounding gardens are described as "a chemical retort in which the human elements are brought together for the reader to observe the resulting reaction." [2] [3]
Theory
The term "elective affinities" is based on the older notion of chemical affinities . In the late 19th century, German sociologist Max Weber , who had read the works of Goethe at the age of 14, used Goethe's conception of human "elective affinities" to formulate a large part of sociology . [4] In early nineteenth century chemistry , the phrase "elective affinities" or chemical affinities was used to describe compounds that only interacted with each other under select circumstances. Goethe used this as an organizing metaphor for marriage , and for the conflict between responsibility and passion.
In the book, people are described as chemical species whose amorous affairs and relationships were pre-determined via chemical affinities similar to the pairings of alchemical species. Goethe outlined the view that passion, marriage , conflict, and free-will are all subject to the laws of chemistry and in which the lives of human species are regulated no differently than the lives of chemical species . [5] [6] [7] Opinions over the years have been split as to whether Goethe's theory was used in metaphor. [8] [9]
In the novella, the central chemical reaction that takes place is a double displacement reaction (double elective affinity), between a married couple Eduard and Charlotte (BA), at the end of their first year of marriage (for each their second marriage), and their two good friends the Captain and Ottilie (CD), respectively. The first marriages, for both Eduard and Charlotte, are described as having been marriages of financial convenience, essentially arranged marriages. Specifically, when they were younger, Eduard was married off to a rich older woman through the workings and insatiable greed of his father; Charlotte, likewise, when her prospects were none the best, was compelled or obliged to marry a wealthy man, whom she did not love.
In the fourth chapter, the characters detail the worldâ€™s first ever verbally-depicted human double displacement chemical reaction. The chapter begins with description of the affinity map (reaction map) or â€˜topographical chartâ€™ as Goethe calls it. On this reaction map, we are told that on it â€˜the features of the estate and its surroundings were clearly depicted, on quite a large scale, in pen and in different colors, to which the Captain had give a firm basis by taking trigonometrical measurementsâ€™.
Next, to explain the reaction, we are told:
â€™provided it does not seem pedantic,â€™ the Captain said, â€˜I think I can briefly sum up in the language of signs. Imagine an A intimately united with a B, so that no force is able to sunder them; imagine a C likewise related to a D; now bring the two couples into contact: A will throw itself at D, C at B, without our being able to say which first deserted its partner, which first embraced the otherâ€™s partner.â€™ This is shown below:
AB + CD â†’ AD + BC
â€˜Now then!â€™ Eduard interposed: â€˜until we see all this with our own eyes, let us look on this formula as a metaphor from which we may extract a lesson we can apply immediately to ourselves. You, Charlotte, represent the A, and I represent your B; for in fact I do depend altogether on you and follow you as A follows B. The C is quite obviously the Captain, who for the moment is to some extent drawing me away from you. Now it is only fair that, if you are not to vanish into the limitless air, you must be provided with a D, and this D is unquestionably the charming little lady Ottilie, whose approaching presence you may no longer resist.â€™
Astrida Tantillo's 2001 book Goethe's Elective Affinities and the Critics [10] notes that:
â€œ
From the time of its publication to today, Goetheâ€™s novel, Die Wahlverwandtschaften (Elective Affinities, 1809), has aroused a storm of interpretive confusion. Readers fiercely debate the role of the chemical theory of elective affinities presented in the novel. Some argue that it suggest a philosophy of nature that is rooted in fate. Others maintain that it is about free choice. Others believe that the chemical theory is merely a structural device that allows the author to foreshadow events in the novel and bears no relevance to the greater issues of the novel.

Adaptations
In 1979, director Francis Ford Coppola , in the grip of clinical manic depression and anxiety over his incomplete opus Apocalypse Now , and while purportedly under the influence of his girlfriend, screenwriter Melissa Mathison , proposed making a "ten-hour film version of Goethe's Elective Affinities, in 3D ". [11]
John Banville's 1982 novel "The Newton Letter" adapts the story to Ireland (description by Gordon Burgess can be found in "German life and letters" April 1992.
The 1993 play Arcadia , by British playwright Tom Stoppard , is a modern-day remake of Elective Affinities, albeit with a twist. The play takes place in modern times and 1809, Goethe's time; characters are replaced subtly, e.g. 'The Captain' becomes 'The Naval Captain'; and the chemical affinity becomes updated in the play with discussion on the second law of thermodynamics , chaos theory , among other subjects; albeit the play still holds to the idea that the characters of reactive entities, discussing ideas such as the " heat " of interactions between the characters.
Robin Gordon's 1995 short story "Leaves in the Wind" adapts the story to modern England, with Edward and Charlotte as an academic couple.
In 1996, a film version was made, entitled The Elective Affinities , by director Paolo Taviani .
