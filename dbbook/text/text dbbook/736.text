Sharn: City of Towers is an accessory for the Eberron setting that details Sharn, the most spectacular city of Khorvaire .
Sharn: City of Towers was written by Keith Baker and James Wyatt , and published in November 2004.

Morrow , Lucio Parrillo , Steve Prescott , Francis Tsai , Anne Stokes , Anthony Waters , and James Zhang .
According to Keith Baker, "Sharn has always been a central part of the setting, and we'd put a lot of thought into it long before we started working on Sharn: City of Towers. Some of the organizations you'll find in Sharn were developed in the ten-page setting proposal way back in 2002." [1]
Reception
The reviewer from Pyramid commented that: "The darkness that Wizards of the Coast tried for (and missed) in the Eberron core rulebook is actually starting to take shape in the second hardback in the series. Sharn: City of Towers brings more of that Dashiell Hammett feel to the surface by touring through the many levels of the lofty city." [2]
