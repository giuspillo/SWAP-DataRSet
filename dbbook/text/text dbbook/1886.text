Regardless of the fact that he always makes it clear that he's not interested in a long-term relationship, women still tend to fall for him. The book is divided into three main sections devoted to the women who are affected by Robin the most: Amanda, a beautiful and emotional model; Maggie, a brilliant journalist; and Judith, a middle-aged socialite.
