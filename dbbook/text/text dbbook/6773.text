Plot
Betsy Taylor, Queen of Vampires, is celebrating her 31st birthday and her 1st anniversary of being dead (or perhaps that should be undead.) She has told her friends that she doesnâ€™t want a party but she is sure that they are planning a surprise party for her.
She is trying to plan her summer wedding to Sinclair but it doesnâ€™t help that he is avoiding having anything to do with it and deciding to give up drinking blood in honour of her birthday is just making her cranky. And nobody likes a cranky vampire.
Jessica her best friend since childhood has been diagnosed with cancer and this leads Betsy to think that maybe converting her friend to become a vampire might be a good idea.
With a delegation of European vampires arriving to pay their respects to her, a baby brother to baby sit, unexpected guests dropping by and a phone that just wonâ€™t stop ringing she has plenty to keep her occupied. And thatâ€™s before she deals with the zombie in the atticâ€¦.
