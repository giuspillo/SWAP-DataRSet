Plot summary
Approximately two years after the events in Furies of Calderon , Tavi is attending the finest school in Alera, The Academy. His patron, the ruler of Alera, has generously paid for his schooling and employed him as a page in the capitol. He still has no furies and remains the only Aleran to have no furycrafting ability. He struggles to deal with his perceived disability while training to be a Cursor of the crown, the First Lord's messengers and covert agents through the realm.
Tavi must confront his peers and enemies alike as Alera is quietly being invaded by the Vord, his Aunt Isana in danger, the First Lord's failing health, and all with the threat of civil war looming over their heads.
