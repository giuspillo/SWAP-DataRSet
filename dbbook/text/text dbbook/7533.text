Plot synopsis
In 1942, the American destroyer USS Walker (DD-163), is part of the United States Asiatic Fleet . Walker is a World War I -era 'four-piper'. Lieutenant Commander Matthew Reddy is Walker's captain.
Walker and her sister ship, USS Mahan (DD-102) , enter a squall and emerge on an alternate Earth where humans never evolved, but two intelligent races, the Lemurians and the Grik (a race of evolved "dinosaurs" from Africa) are at war. The Grik have a class system, in which the Uul are the soldiers, workers, etc., and the Hij are the leaders. The Lemurians are peaceful refugees from Madagascar that possibly evolved from lemurs. Reddy meets twice with the Lemurians' leadership. The Lemurians' king and his advisers tell him that there were others who'd come to their world before him. Reddy and the crew of Walker side with the Lemurians.
