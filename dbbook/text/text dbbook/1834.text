The Veiled One is a novel by British crime-writer Ruth Rendell. It is the 14th entry in the Inspector Wexford series.
Plot summary
The book begins when a garotted body is found in a deserted subterranean Kingsmarkham car-park. The victim is Gwen Robson, a middle-aged home help and resident of the town. However, before Wexford can investigate any further he is the victim of a politically motivated car-bomb that was intended for his daughter, Sheila, a well-known actress who has recently caused controversy with a high-profile protest on Ministry of Defence Property. With his boss out of commission in hospital, Detective Inspector Mike Burden must forge ahead alone in the investigation, and quickly narrows in on a suspect. However, without Wexford to rein Burden in, is he in danger of being too short-sighted?
