It tells the history and principles of modern physics. He brings us behind the scenes of the most intellectual tales as he seeks to "combine Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Richard Feynman's idea of multiple histories into one complete unified theory that will describe everything that happens in the universe. " The Universe in a Nutshell is winner of the Aventis Prizes for Science Books 2002.
