Voice of the Whirlwind is a 1987 cyberpunk science fiction novel by Walter Jon Williams.
Plot introduction
Etienne Steward is a clone, also known as a beta. When he awakes, his memories are fifteen years old, because the original Stewardâ€”the alphaâ€”never bothered to have his memories updated.
In those fifteen years, the entire world has changed. An alien race known as The Powers has established relations with humanity. The Orbital Policorp which held his allegiance has collapsed. He fought and survived the off-world Artifacts War, but dozens of his friends did not. Both his first and second wives have divorced him.
More importantly, someone has murdered him, causing the activation of the beta back-up. Now Steward has to figure out who wanted him dead, if he doesn't want to die again.
