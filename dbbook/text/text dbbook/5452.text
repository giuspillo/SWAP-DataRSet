Critical reception
Booklist called The Manhattan Hunt Club an "enjoyable and clever yarn", praising the book's "plot twists, improbable conspiracies, and lots of two-faced characters". [1] Publishers Weekly wrote that the book "kirts absurdity, as do the villainous members of the club, but Saul scores points about society's treatment of the homeless" and that it was "vintage Saul". [2] People Magazine stated "Stirring social commentary, this ain't, but it's a hot tome for summer in the city." [3] Kirkus Reviews criticized The Manhattan Hunt Club's "barely believable premise" but praised the book's research and "supportive subplots". [4] RT Book Reviews gave The Manhattan Hunt Club three stars, writing "Although his trademark elements of supernatural horror are missing, fans won't be disappointed" [5]
