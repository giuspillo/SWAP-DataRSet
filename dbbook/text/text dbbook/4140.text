The Secret of Chimneys is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first published in the UK by The Bodley Head in June 1925 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year. It introduces the characters of, among others, Superintendent Battle and Lady Eileen "Bundle" Brent. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00. Christie later used the "Chimneys" mansion, along with the characters Bill Eversleigh, Bundle, George Lomax, Tredwell and Lord Caterham from this book in the 1929 novel The Seven Dials Mystery.

Literary significance and reception
The Times Literary Supplement reviewed the novel in its issue of 9 July 1925 and, after setting up the story, stated favourably that "there is ... a thick fog of mystery, cross-purposes and romance, which leads up to a most unexpected and highly satisfactory ending". [4]
The reviewer for The Observer wrote on 28 June 1925: "Mrs Christie plunges lightheartedly into a real welter of murders, innocently-implicated lookers-on, Balkan politics (of the lighter Ruritanian kind), impersonators, secret societies, ciphers, experts, secret hiding-places, detectives (real and pretended), and emerges triumphantly at the end, before her readers are too hopelessly befogged. Nobody is killed who matters much. The right people marry, after it all, having first endeared themselves to us by their frivolous attitude to the singularly animated doings around them." The reviewer concluded that Christie's "ingenuity and clear-headedness are really remarkable." [5]
The review in The Scotsman of 16 July 1925 began, "Despite Herzoslovakian politics and a background of oil and finance, this new novel by Agatha Christie gets a grip of the reader when it comes down to the business of disposing of a corpse, innocently come by but not to be repudiated without danger of grave scandal" and went on to say, "It is an exciting story with a bewildering array of potential murderers and a curious collection of detectives, amateur and professional, and with a crook of international importance and (alleged) consummate ability." The review concluded: "There is more than murder in this story; there is a treasure hunt in it, not for gold but a diamond, and the story is suitably staged for the main part at Chimneys, that historic mansion whose secret will be found in Chapter XXIX, though the wise in these matters may have discovered it a little earlier". [6]
Robert Barnard : "If you can take all of the racialist remarks, which are very much of their time, this is a first-class romp, all the better for not being of the 'plot to take over the world' variety. It concerns the throne and crown jewels of Herzoslovakia, and combines such Hope-ful [ sic ] elements with bright young things and some effective caricatures. By far the least awful of the early thrillers." [7]
Charles Osborne : "The Secret of Chimneys is one of the best of Agatha Christie's early thrillers (...). Her attitude to democracy is so unsympathetic, at least as expressed by a character of whom Mrs. Christie evidently approves, that it reveals an unexpectedly authoritarian aspect of the author's nature". [8]
The novel was not reviewed in The New York Times Book Review .

Film, TV or theatrical adaptations
1931 stage adaptation
The Secret of Chimneys was adapted by Christie into a stage play in 1931 but its planned performance was cancelled. Nonetheless, a copy was placed in the British Library where it was read by numerous enthusiasts who decided to comply with a request from Christie's daughter not to reveal its existence. Twenty years later, another copy surfaced in Canada, where it received its world premiere on 16 October 2003.

Graphic novel adaptation
The Secret of Chimneys was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 20 August 2007, adapted by FranÃ§ois RiviÃ¨re and illustrated by Laurence Suhner ( ISBN 0-00-725059-2 ). This was translated from the edition first published in France by Emmanuel Proust Ã©ditions in 2002 under the title of Le Secret de Chimneys.
Television adaptation
An adaptation was produced for the fifth series of Marple , with Julia McKenzie as the lead. The adaptation retains Chimneys as the setting. However, the substitution of Miss Marple as the main detective is only the first of many changes made to the story, which amalgamates and renames several characters, turns the political connection (transferred from the fictitious Herzoslovakia to Austria ) into one of several red herrings, and comprehensively changes both the murderer's identity and motive.
It also features elements from the Miss Marple short story, " The Herb of Death ".
Its cast includes Edward Fox as Lord Caterham, Anthony Higgins as Count Ludwig, Jonas Armstrong as Anthony Cade, Charlotte Salt as Virginia Revel and Dervla Kirwan as Bundle. Dervla Kirwan , in her late thirties, played Bundle, who, though still the daughter of Lord Caterham, was cast as the sister of 23-year old Lady Virginia Revel ( Charlotte Salt ), an unrelated character in the original story. Of the two, Lady Virginia appeared to have more in common with the Bundle of the novels. The Radio Times observed that this production was "classic Agatha Christie, even though it's only distantly related to her original ... purists will be utterly flummoxed â€“ and the plot has more holes in it than the murder victim".

This was the last novel published under Christie's six book contract with the Bodley Head which had been agreed back in 1919. Christie had signed without literary agent representation and had come to resent its terms which she stated were unfair. [10] Her future books in the UK were all published by William Collins & Sons (with the sole exception of The Hound of Death ) once a new and more favourable contract had been signed with them by her newly appointed agent, Edmund Cork of Hughes Massey. Cork became a lifelong friend.
This novel was much admired by her future mother-in-law, Mrs Marguerite Mallowan, who penned a note in a leather-bound copy she commissioned of this book together with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and The Hollow . The note read "Passing a bookshop while I was in Paris in 1932, I bought The Secret of Chimneys, now almost unobtainable. I had just heard of Agatha Christie. Though not a reader of detective stories, her book captivated me so much that I never left it until I had finished it. Soon after she married my son, whom she had met in Mesopotamia while he was working under Sir Leonard Woolley . Later I read The Murder of Roger Ackroyd which, I think, made her reputation universal. Lastly came The Hollow , a book dear to me as revealing her artistic, simple and sincere temperament. This is the reason for my choice of these three books to be bound together. I wish them to be a testimony of my admiration for her art, and above all, of my gratitude for her loving kindness through all the years I have known her". The copy of the book was sold at auction in September 2006. [11]
Book dedication
In the Bantam edition, the dedication is to "Punkie", who is Madge, Christie's older sister. [12] In other editions the dedication reads:
"To my Nephew. In memory of an inscription at Compton Castle and a day at the Zoo."
The "nephew" was Jack Watts (1903â€“1961), the son of Christie's brother-in-law and sister James and 'Madge' Watts. Christie became very close to her nephew after his birth when she was thirteen and joined her mother in looking after him at his home, Abney Hall , when her sister and brother-in-law went on skiing holidays to St Moritz and at Christmas. [13] She writes enthusiastically about her memories of this time in the foreword to her 1960 collection of short stories The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding . The references to Compton Castle and the zoo are obscure. It is possible that the house "Chimneys" is based on Compton Castle, but Abney Hall is equally probable. Christie gives no description of â€œChimneysâ€� in the book, merely stating that "Descriptions of that historic place can be found in any guidebook.â€� [14]
Dustjacket blurb
The dustjacket front flap of the first edition carried no specially written blurb . Instead, both the front and back flap carried advertisements for Christie's five other Bodley Head books together with one or two short quotes from reviews of those books.
