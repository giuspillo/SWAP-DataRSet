Plot
The body of Caroline Hartley is found one evening before Christmas by her lover, Veronica Shildon. It is a cosy sceneâ€“log fire, sheepskin rug, Vivaldi on the stereo, Christmas lights and treeâ€“but Caroline is naked and covered in blood. Detective Constable Susan Gay is the first detective at the scene. She has recently been promoted to C.I.D. and the case soon takes on overwhelming professional and personal importance for her. DC Gay and Chief Inspector Alan Banks soon find plenty of suspects as they begin to delve into Carolineâ€™s past and the womenâ€™s present life: Veronicaâ€™s ex-husband, who is a well-known composer; a feminist poet; the cast and crew of a play Caroline was rehearing; and Carolineâ€™s eccentric, reclusive brother, Gary Hartley. Inspector Banksâ€™s fifth case is an ironic, suspenseful tale of family secrets, hidden passions and desperate violence.
