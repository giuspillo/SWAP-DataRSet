A fortnight passes and Carrie doesn't return. McGee investigates and learns she died in a traffic accident but he believes she has been murdered. His investigation leads him to an apartment complex full of singles presided over by a landlord called 'Big Daddy'. He also meets the newly widowed 'Cindy Birdsong', who becomes his new romantic interest.
