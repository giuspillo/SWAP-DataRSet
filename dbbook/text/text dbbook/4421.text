Premise
The key premise of the book is that because the mind and body are connected, illnesses of the body have their root causes in emotional and spiritual aspects of the mind and its beliefs and thought processes. While modern medicine concerns itself solely with eliminating the negative symptoms of disease in the body, using tools such as chemotherapy and other pharmaceutical drugs and various surgical techniques, Hay's approach is to identify and work to resolve the mental root causes of disease. If it is accepted that the causes of "dis-ease" include stress and unhealthy thought patterns and beliefs about oneself, then it follows that the most fundamental way to affect positive change in the body is to change the way we think, using tools such as "mirror work" and affirmations . At the end of book, a separate section lists numerous illnesses and the emotional thought patterns that tend to cause them; this was derived from Hay's earlier book, Heal Your Body, which had its origins in a pamphlet she published in 1979.
