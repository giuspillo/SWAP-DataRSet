The Confession is a 2010 legal thriller novel by John Grisham, his second novel to be published in 2010 . The novel is about the murder of a high school cheerleader and how an innocent man is arrested for it. This was Grisham's first novel to be released simultaneously in digital and hardcopy format.
Plot summary
In 1998, Travis Boyette abducted and raped Nicole "Nikki" Yarber, a teenage girl and high school student in Slone, Texas and buried her body in Joplin, Missouri some 6 hours from Slone. He watches unfazed as the police arrest and convict DontÃ© Drumm, a black high school football player with no connection with the crime. Despite his innocence, Drumm is convicted and sentenced to death. He has been on death row for nine years when the story takes place. While Drumm serves his prison sentence, lawyer Robbert "Robbie" Flak fights his case while Black Americans protest his false conviction, creating a law and order situation.
Meanwhile, Boyette had fled to Kansas and had lived there ever since. He had been suffering with brain tumor for the past nine years and his health had deteriorated. In 2007, with Drumm's execution only a week away, reflecting on his miserable life, he decides to do what is right; confess. He meets a priest Reverend Keith Schroeder who takes him to Slone. Despite his confession to the public, the execution proceeds on and Drumm is executed by lethal injection. Boyette then reveals the resting place of Nikki and DNA samples show signs of rape and assault on her body.
List of characters
DontÃ© Drumm
DontÃ©'s ordeal begins as an 17-year-old with everything going for him. He has only had mild altercations with law enforcement, for possession of marijuana when he was a little younger. Now he is a star on the high school football team and loved by the girls. His potential and ambition inspire jealousy in Joey Gamble who, when rejected by Nicole, takes this out on DontÃ©. Joey tips off the police with an anonymous phone-call, later proven to be his using voice-analysis. When the police take DontÃ© in for questioning, this is not formally an arrest and DontÃ© naÄ©vely but in good faith, to expedite matters, signs away his Miranda rights. This is the catalyst which sees him detained for the next nine years and ultimately executed.
Roberta Drumm
The long-suffering mother of DontÃ© who is convinced her son is innocent and prays constantly for a reprieve. She is part of a large family. Her husband, DontÃ©'s father Riley Drumm, died of heart disease whilst DontÃ© was on death row.
Nicole "Nikki" Yarber
The girl whose brutal rape and suspected killing led to capital murder charges, a crime which upon conviction, can lead to a death sentence in the State of Texas. Nicole had everything going for her and was a cheerleader and sang in church.
Reeva Pike
The girl's mother. Reeva is loud-mouthed and theatrical in her behaviour as well as irrational. She has been known to drive more than a hundred miles downriver to where it was speculated her daughter's body may have been dumped. She is adamant that the death penalty is right and is happy to say this to anyone who will listen. Reeva lives with her partner who is not Nicole's father and seems exasperated with Reeva's nine years of agony.
Travis Boyette
The real killer who had actually been in police custody in Slone at the same time DontÃ© was detained. He is a serial rapist and had been abused himself from the age of eight by a sick uncle who told his parent or guardian that they were going "fishing". He claims to be suffering from terminal brain cancer and carries a cane because of an apparent limp. It turns out the tumor is not malignant and the cane is there for protection in his half-way house. His seizures however, and intense headaches, are real. He has spent more than half of his 44 years in prisons. He remains a creep throughout and on a number of occasions intimates to Reverend Schroeder how he thinks his wife Dana is "cute".
Robbie Flak
The heir to the family Flak Law Firm. This advocate works tirelessly for his clients. He makes a promise to DontÃ© minutes before his execution that he would find the real killer and exonerate his name for the sake of his family and mother â€“ and throw a party to celebrate at his graveside. Robbie leaves no stone left unturned for clients on death-row and goes the extra mile. He files every possible motion in his appeals and he does not consider his job finished for DontÃ© until he has sued everyone responsible for his wrongful execution, even those parties for whom immunity from prosecution applies. Outside of law, Robbie does not seem to have much social life and both he and his romantic partner are happy to keep their work lives separate. Robbie is not particularly religious and yet gets invited by the Black community of Slone to speak at DontÃ©'s funeral.
Reverend Keith Schroeder
The Kansas-based Lutheran pastor, who aids and abets in the transportation of a convicted felon across state lines. Schroeder strives to see the best in all people and emphasizes forgiveness. He has strong scruples and battles with himself to discern in complex situations what is the right thing. He is seen towards the end of the book trying to bring out in DontÃ© his past belief in God, when all hope for a last-minute reprieve from the Governor has been abandoned. Keith is married to Dana, who is substituting for his regular secretary at the Mission on the day that Boyette first meets Keith.
Judge Elias Henry
This judge is the only one who gets on well with Robbie. He is well respected although in the past he had lost out to politics and suffered a nervous breakdown. He wrote numerous articles during the civil rights movement of the 1960s and was considered to be a little radical among the Whites of Texas during that period. Judge Henry had always considered the DontÃ© case to be thoroughly flawed and he would have thrown it out at opening trial had he been sitting at the time. Judge Henry lives with his wife.
Joey Gamble
Gamble's false testimony was crucial in the prosecution's case against DontÃ©. He was jealous of DontÃ© and wanted the death of the girl he fancied to be blamed on DontÃ© and pathetically assumed the cops would wind up dismissing it all. At the last minute, he agreed to sign an affidavit recanting his testimony and admitting he committed perjury but it was too late.
Detective Drew Kerber
The detective who arrested and questioned DontÃ© during the case. He is a cruel, evil and selfish character who, despite countless innocent protests from DontÃ©, persists in shouting and angrily accusing him. He eventually obtains a false confession from DontÃ© through shouting and trickery, although it is implied that he may have beaten DontÃ© for good measure, given that he is found lying on the floor weeping by the end of Kerber's questioning. During Robbie Flak's conference, it is mentioned that he has a "history of false confessions", implying that many other innocent lives may have been wrongly convicted as well by him.
Prosecutor Paul Koffee
The prosecutor presiding over the Nicole Yarber case. Both he and Kerber can be seen as the main villains of the story, as they are both unrelenting, evil characters who manage to convict DontÃ© with false evidence, and false testimony. The possibility of DontÃ© being innocent never seems to occur to Paul, as he only cares about his reputation, which takes a nosedive when his scandal with Judge Vivian Grale is revealed to the world. He even has the nerve to suggest that DontÃ© may have had an "accomplice" once Nicole's body was found, all in an effort to save his reputation which he craves more than the life of an innocent man.
Gill Newton
The Governor of Texas. A supporter of capital punishment who refuses to postpone the execution even after seeing Travis' televised confession. Once he learns of DontÃ©'s innocence, he childishly feigns ignorance of seeing Travis' confession, and desperately attempts to settle matters in the Middle East, just to leave his country. Like Koffee, Kerber and Judge Vivian Grale, he too only cares about his reputation, and does not acknowledge DontÃ© Drumm as an innocent man despite the violent riots which tear the streets of Texas apart.
Critical reception
Chris Erskine writing in the Los Angeles Times reviewed the novel in a favorable light, commenting on Grisham's deft ability at pacing in his novels. [2]
Writing in the Religious Left Law blog, David Nickol was adversely critical of the novel for not doing what it set out, presumably, to achieve, i.e. to present a firm case against the death-penalty through the medium of fiction. Its failings, he said, derive from the fact that the events of the DontÃ© case "are so egregious that...[o]ne does not need to be a death-penalty opponent to find repugnant the blatant railroading of someone so clearly innocent". [3]
Maureen Corrigan in the Washington Post reviewed the novel in terms of the way in which Grisham gets across a message to the reader about his own views on the death penalty deriving from his work on the Innocence Project . This and the race issue that divides the community in Texas between Blacks and Whites is described by Corrigan as Grisham's "superb work of social criticism". Corrigan, however, does not consider the book to be easy reading: "don't read this book if you just want to kick back in your recliner and relax," she writes; "Grisham doesn't spare his readers or himself from gruesome experiences or hard questions." [4]
Relations between events in the novel and real life cases
Much of the fictional case presented in the novel is taken from some real-life cases involving defendants on death row. The part where the prosecutor and the judge were sleeping together allegedly occurred in the case of Charles D. Hood. Also, a slightly late petition to the TCCA that was denied because the doors had been locked and that the chief justice (Milton Prudlowe in the novel) had refused an extension happened in the case of Michael Wayne Richard . DontÃ©'s last statement is partly derived from the actual last statement of Cameron Todd Willingham , as is the dubious science partly used to convict him (a sniffer dog). DontÃ© himself refers directly to the Willingham case when talking about how inmates die: â€œSome donâ€™t say a word, just close their eyes and wait for the poison. A few go out kicking. Todd Willingham died three years ago, always claimed to be innocent. They said he started a house fire that burned up his three little girls. Yet he was in the house and got burned too. He was a fighter. He cussed â€™em in his final statement.â€�
The novel also mentions several real life murderers as having been executed in 1999, who in real life were indeed executed on the dates stated in the novel: Desmond Jennings, John Lamb, Jose Guiterrez, James Beathard, Robert Atworth and Sammie Felder Jr. (See List of individuals executed in Texas, 1990-1999 )
