Background
On a train ride in Wheaton, Maryland , Penn witnessed a ritual in which a mother raccoon placed its nose on a baby raccoon's paw, and then the baby raccoon placed its paw on its own face. [1] [4] The park ranger said that the purpose of the ritual was to transfer scent from the mother to the baby so that the baby could recall the mother's scent by bringing its paw to its face. [1] Penn "started a similar ritual with her daughter â€” kissing her hand and telling her that whenever she was homesick, she could put her hand to her face." [1]
Penn wrote The Kissing Hand based on the raccoons' ritual. Penn read the book at VSA arts , and Jean Kennedy Smith wrote the book's foreword. [4]
Summary
Chester is a young raccoon who is nervous about going to school. [4] His mother kisses his palm and tells him that "whenever you feel lonely and need a little loving from home, just press your hand to your cheek and think, 'Mommy loves you. Mommy loves you.'" [4] Chester is comforted and goes to school.
Reception
