The Miocene Arrow is a post-apocalyptic novel by Sean McMullen. It is the middle book of the Greatwinter trilogy.
Plot summary
In isolated pockets of what used to be America , humans fight stylized duels in small, biodiesel -powered airplanes. In a land where chivalry and honor are everything, what happens when rebels from Australia , enamored of the amazing technology held by the Americans, hatch a plot to bring some of it back to their homes?
Reception
Publishers Weekly said that "the tale features labyrinthine politics, a large cast of engaging, thorny and occasionally rather cartoonish characters, and many well depicted scenes of aerial warfare . The authors inventive use of several oddball technologies is particularly noteworthy, and veteran SF readers may well be reminded of L. Sprague de Camp ." [1]
