With the Lightnings is a science fiction novel by David Drake. It is the first part of the military space opera RCN Series.
Development
The style and character dynamics trace their lineage back to A Grand Tour by David Drake from More Than Honor , a story in the Honorverse setting. Although the setting universe is entirely separate, careful reading may reveal similarities to the first novel in this series. Both were published in 1998. Indeed Drake confirms that A Grand Tour is the conceptual antecedent of With the Lightnings. [1]
Plot
During a war between a Republic of Cinnabar and the Alliance of Free Stars, a coup d'Ã©tat takes place on a neutral planet of Kostroma, with both factions becoming involved. Two Cinnabarian protagonists - a navy lieutenant and emigre librarian - find themselves in the center of the unfolding events.
