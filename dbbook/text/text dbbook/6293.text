Lord John and the Private Matter is a historical mystery novel written by Diana Gabaldon. It was originally intended to be another novella, but became much longer than planned. It is the first novel to feature Lord John Grey as the protagonist. Set in 1757 England, it portrays Grey's attempt to resolve a delicate situation involving his cousin's betrothed, Joseph Trevelyan, whilst searching for the murderer of a fellow soldier suspected of espionage. {{#invoke: Navbox | navbox }}
Origins
Gabaldon introduced Grey in the second Outlander novel Dragonfly in Amber (1992) as a sixteen-year-old English soldier who chances upon Jamie and Claire Fraser on the eve of the Battle of Prestonpans . The character returned in Voyager (1994) and Drums of Autumn (1997). When Gabaldon was invited to write a short story for the 1998 British anthology Past Poisons: An Ellis Peters Memorial Anthology of Historical Crime, she was interested in the challenge of writing a shorter work but hesitant to use any of the main characters from the Outlander series for fear of creating "a stumbling block in the growth of the next novel." [2] The Lord Grey character came to mind. [3]
"Lord John Grey is an important character in the Outlander series, but he isnâ€™t onstage all the time. And when he isnâ€™t â€¦ well, plainly heâ€™s off leading his life and having adventures elsewhere, and I could write about any of those adventures without causing complications for future novels. Beyond that obvious advantage, Lord John is a fascinating character. Heâ€™s what I call a 'mushroom' â€” one of those unplanned people who pops up out of nowhere and walks off with any scene heâ€™s in â€” and he talks to me easily (and wittily). Heâ€™s also a gay man, in a time when to be homosexual was a capital offense, and Lord John has more than most to lose by discovery. He belongs to a noble family, heâ€™s an officer in His Majestyâ€™s Army, and loves both his family and his regiment; to have his private life discovered would damage â€” if not destroy â€” both. Consequently, he lives constantly with conflict, which makes him both deeply entertaining and easy to write about." [2]
That first Lord John story became Lord John and the Hellfire Club (1998); it was well-received and Gabaldon decided that she would write more Grey-centric tales in her spare time. [2] [3] Her next attempt was a larger manuscript that secured the author a deal for three full Grey novels: Lord John and the Private Matter (2003), Lord John and the Brotherhood of the Blade (2007) and The Scottish Prisoner (2011). [2] [3] Gabaldon would also write four additional Lord John novellas between 2003 and 2011. [2] Meanwhile, the character of Grey appeared in the Outlander novels A Breath of Snow and Ashes (2005) and An Echo in the Bone (2009), as well as in The Fiery Cross (2001) by way of a series of letters to Jamie and his family.
Lord John Grey himself has been called one of Gabaldon's "most complex and interesting" Outlander characters. [1] Publishers Weekly notes Grey to be "a competent and likable sleuth" [4] and a " soldier-hero with secrets of his own." [5] Comfortable with his sexuality but necessarily "discreet", Grey navigates mystery and intrigue "with characteristic Ã©lan, intelligence, and fortitude, assisted by jeweled goblets of wine and meaningful glances from fetching men." [6]
â€œ
A gay man in a time when that particular predilection could get one hanged, Lord John is a man accustomed to keeping secrets. He's also a man of honor and deep affections â€” whether returned or not. [1]

To date, the Lord John works all take place between 1756 and 1761, during the events of Gabaldon's Voyager. [2] [7] They can be generally categorized as historical mysteries, and the three novels are shorter and focus on fewer plot threads than the main Outlander books. [7]
Lord John and the Hellfire Club (1998)
The novella Lord John and the Hellfire Club was originally published in the 1998 British anthology Past Poisons: An Ellis Peters Memorial Anthology of Historical Crime (edited by Maxim Jakubowski ), [7] [8] as well as by Bantam Dell as Lord John and the Hell-Fire Club in a "Complimentary Collector's Special Edition" the same year. [9] It was later included in the Lord John and the Hand of Devils collection (2007). [2] [7] [10]
Set in 1756 London, the novella follows the adventures of Lord John as he stumbles upon the secrets of the Hellfire Club , an underground society concerned with the supernatural . While at the Beefsteak Club , Grey is introduced to Robert Gerald, a cousin by marriage to Grey's friend and colleague, Harry Quarry. Gerald asks Grey to meet him in secret that night, hinting at intrigue, but he is later killed in front of Grey and Quarry before he can divulge the reason for the meeting. The two men begin to search for clues to the murder, and Grey is soon invited to a Hellfire Club meeting by George Everett, one of its members (and one of Grey's former lovers). When Grey attends the meeting at the club's hideout, Medmenham Abbey , he soon discovers that his life might be in danger as well. [5] [6] [10]

[2] [3] [11] Private Matter reached #8 on The New York Times Hardcover Fiction Best-Seller List .

Set in 1758, the story finds Lord John in Prussia serving as the English liaison officer to the First Regiment of Hanoverian Foot. Briefly stationed at the town of Gundwitz with a group of English and Hanoverian soldiers, Major Grey is at first skeptical when he receives reports of a local succubus victimizing a number of men and murdering a Prussian soldier. Accompanying the town Buergermeister to a graveyard in his search for the creature's resting place, Grey stumbles upon the corpse of an English soldier, which only feeds the superstitious fears of the soldiers and townspeople. While attempting to solve the mystery, Grey tries to navigate his perhaps-mutual attraction to the dashing Hanoverian Captain Stephan von Namtzen, as well as to deflect the advances of the beautiful young widow Louisa, Princess von Lowenstein, at whose castle both men are staying.

[3]
Picking up right after the events of Brotherhood of the Blade in 1759, Grey searches for the culprit behind a suspicious cannon explosion as others seek to blame him or his half brother for the incident. [5] [6] [7] [10] [16]
