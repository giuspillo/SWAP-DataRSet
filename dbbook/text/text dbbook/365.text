JPod was adopted as a CBC television series co-written by Douglas Coupland.

The first thirteen episodes of the series aired in the United States on The CW Television Network.
Plot
JPod is an avant-garde novel of six young adults, whose last names all begin with the letter 'J' and who are assigned to the same cubicle pod by someone in human resources through a computer glitch , working at Neotronic Arts, a fictional Burnaby -based video game company. Ethan Jarlewski is the novel's main character and narrator , who spends more time involved with his work than with his dysfunctional family . His stay-at-home mother runs a successful marijuana grow-op which allows his father to abandon his career and work as a futile movie extra . Ethan's realtor brother Greg involves himself with Asian crime lord Kam Fong who serves as the plot's crux of character connection.
The JPod staff are required to insert a turtle character based on Jeff Probst into the skateboard game that they are developing as 'BoardX'. The marketing manager, Steven Lefkowitz, mandates the turtle's addition to the game because he is trying to please his son during a custody battle. JPod is then drastically challenged and changed when Steve goes missing and the new executive replacement declares that the game will be changed yet again. Upper management decides to change Jeff the turtle for an adventurous prince who rides a magic carpet. The game is then renamed "SpriteQuest". The JPodders, upset that they would not be able to finish their game, decide to sabotage SpriteQuest by inserting a deranged Ronald McDonald . They do this by creating a secret level where Ronald works malevolence, thus creating, in their opinion, a culturally-suitable game for the target market.
Ethan begins to date the newest addition to JPod, Kaitlin, and their relationship grows as she discovers that most of the members of the team, including herself, are mildly autistic . Kaitlin develops a hugging machine after researching how autistic people enjoy the sensation of pressure from non-living things on their skin.
Douglas Coupland, as a character, is inserted into the novel when Ethan visits China to bring a heroin -addicted Steve back to Canada . This Google -version of Douglas Coupland consistently bumps into Ethan and manages to weave himself into the narrator's life. JPod finds itself in a digital world where technology is everything and the human mind is incapable of focusing on just one task.

BookShorts; a short video film depicting characters of JPod was filmed in 2006 by BookShorts.com project with support from Random House Canada. [1]
Microserfs; JPod has been described frequently as an updating of Couplandâ€™s 1995 novel Microserfs for the 2000s. Publisherâ€™s Weekly even called JPod â€œMicroserfs 2.0â€�. [2] Both novels centre around a group of eccentric young programming professionals. Both books are narrated by a young male (Ethan Jarlewski in JPod, Daniel Underwood in Microserfs). Both of these characters write the novel manuscript on a laptop, and both novels feature random product names, slogans, and messages in varying font size. In Microserfs, Daniel types in these random messages in an attempt to tap into his computerâ€™s subconscious, while in JPod, the messages reflect the stream of messages, and consciousness, that computer users experience everyday. The narrator in both novels also begins and maintains a relationship with a female co-worker; Daniel dates Karla and Ethan dates Kaitlin. Both novels also deal heavily with lifestyle in the modern age of technology. In addition, the characters in both novels are introduced by the narrator through a piece of pop culture: in Microserfs, Daniel lists his co-workersâ€™ dream categories in a game of Jeopardy! and in JPod, Ethan asks his co-workers to design an eBay page for themselves. Finally, both novels touch on autism . In Microserfs, Daniel says that he thinks that all tech people are autistic, and in JPod, Kaitlin describes all of her co-workers and her boss as mildly autistic. On an interesting side note, hugging machines as described in the novel have actually been developed to help those with autism. [3]
Sitcoms; JPod was called by one reviewer â€œa 448 page sitcomâ€�. [4] The style of humor is very similar to that of sitcoms , and especially of Arrested Development . The humor mostly originates from character flaws. The characters themselves do not have much depth, and their flaws are exaggerated for comic effect. For example, John Doe is obsessed with being an 'average person' and many of his actions result from this singular character trait.
Terry; Terry is Douglas Couplandâ€™s pictorial biography of Terry Fox , written to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Terryâ€™s 1981 death and published in 2005. Coupland was writing both Terry and JPod simultaneously, and Coupland was quoted in the Jerusalem Post saying that all of his â€œmore noble character traits went into [Terry]. There was a tar-pit of ooze left over that wanted to go somewhere. JPod was it." [5] This helps to explain the malicious version of Douglas Coupland (Anti-Doug) who appears in the novel.
Epistolary novels; Parts of the text of JPod are written as e-mails, text messages, and other messages written by the characters themselves. Therefore, JPod can be considered partly an epistolary novel , although much of the novel is also standard narrative format.
Self-insertion; JPod makes extensive use of the literary device of self-insertion , in which the author himself appears as a character. Other examples of this technique appear in The Canterbury Tales , The Divine Comedy , and numerous other fictional works.
Video gaming; JPod draws similarities to several real-life elements of the video gaming world. For example, the company that the characters work at is called Neotronic Arts, which is extremely similar to the real company Electronic Arts . Besides the similarity in the name, both video game companies have their main office in Burnaby , close to the freeway, and both deal heavily in sports games.
TV series; A TV series based on the novel was produced by CBC and began airing in January 2008. The show starred David Kopp , Emilie Ullerup , Ben Ayres, Steph Song , Torrance Coombs , Colin Cunningham , Sherry Miller , and Alan Thicke . Six of the episodes were written or co-written by Douglas Coupland . The show began airing on Tuesday nights, but because of low ratings it was moved to Friday nights. The continued low ratings resulted in CBC announcing the cancellation of the series in March 2008, despite the fan-based protest that this sparked. A total of 13 episodes were produced. The executive producer of the series, Larry Sugar, blamed CBC for the cancellation, saying that they had not done enough to promote the show. [6]
Reviews of JPod
JPod has been received with mixed reception from literary critics. Some felt it is just an unsuccessful update of Microserfs, with no added substance, while others enjoyed its entertaining style and satire .
Favourable
Favourable reviews of JPod largely focus on its entertaining qualities arising from the improbable-probable lives and quirks of the characters. As a Post-Gutenberg novel JPod is recognized for reflecting the fragmented state of the technology saturated generation, illustrating this generationâ€™s inability to concentrate on one item for more than a few seconds.
John Elkâ€™s review of JPod comments on the novel being an affirmative updating of Couplandâ€™s previous Microserfs , for the " Google generation ". Coupland is mentioned as being â€œpossibly the most gifted exegete of North American mass culture writing todayâ€�, with JPod being â€œhis strongest, best-observed novel since Microserfs." [7] JPod is described as an engaging book, with bizarre characters and devices making it â€œdefinitely worth the readâ€� and while it is â€œnot fully satisfying, it is entertainingâ€�. [8]
Another review of JPod describes how the fragmentation of the book relates to the autistic characteristics of the characters. The book is about the technology and video game generation, who â€œparadoxically have superhuman powers on concentration, yet canâ€™t seem to focus on anythingâ€�. [4] This message is brought up throughout the book, which tends to provoke the reader to really think about the effects of technology on our society.
Unfavourable
On the other hand, many critics were frustrated and irritated by the book. Dennis Lim of The Village Voice called it â€œsmug, vacuous, easily distracted, and often supremely irritatingâ€�. [9] He did note, however, that this â€œmay be purposeful, but it's not in service of a meaningful larger pointâ€”unless you count the unmissable observation that too much information is, like, overwhelmingâ€�. John Elk said that Coupland â€œis neither a master of plot nor of characterizationâ€�, [7] and his characters were also called â€œhollowed-out cartoonsâ€�. [9]
Coupland was further criticized by critics like David Daley of USA Today , who wrote that â€œsubtlety still eludes Couplandâ€� and that his â€œrelentless riffing can be exhaustingâ€�. [10] The 41 pages spent listing digits of pi , for example, were found by many to be pointless and, as Patrick Ness noted, â€œlazily assembledâ€�. [11] As well, many critics found that Couplandâ€™s appearance as a character was annoying, â€œ narcissistic â€� and â€œan obvious and sort of sad attempt to turn [himself] into a cultural iconâ€�. [4] Other critics wondered if Coupland simply inserted himself because he didnâ€™t know how else to end it. [10]
