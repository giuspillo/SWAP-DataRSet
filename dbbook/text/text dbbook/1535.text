Plot summary
It is 1944. A message from Paris warns Allied Intelligence of something big in the works---which might have serious implications for Operation Overlord . The only way to get more information from the agent in Paris---now closely watched by the Gestapo ---is to send in a personal courier.
Russian Ã©migrÃ© Michael Gallatin is picked for the job. In retirement as a secret agent since a grisly episode in North Africa , Gallatin is parachuted into occupied France , on a mission which will take him to the festering heart of the Third Reich on the scent of doomsday.
As a master spy, Gallatin has proved he can take on formidable foes---and kill them. As a passionate lover, he attracts beautiful women. But there is one extra factor which makes Michael Gallatin a unique special agent---he is a werewolf , able to change form at will, able to assume the body of a wolf and its capacity to kill with savage, snarling fury.
In the madness of war, Gallatin hunts his prey---ready to outthink his opponents with his finely tuned brain. Or tear their throats out with his finely honed teeth.
The novel flashes back to when his parents and sister were brutally murdered and before and after Michael is bitten by a Werewolf. Once bitten, he becomes a werewolf and lives in isolation with a wolf clan in Russian forests. Michael Gallatin is a British emigrant that is a top spy for Britain during World War II. In 1942, he overtakes Rommel in North Africa and foils the Nazis plan to control the Suez Canal. This vital waterway would ensure that Nazi Germany could choke off Allied shipping and continue their march east into Russia. In 1944, the war still rages on and the Nazis are forced toward Berlin by the Soviets, but Western Europe is still in Hitlerâ€™s grip. Gallatin, in seclusion since 1942, is called back for a vital mission: The first part of the mission has him parachuting into Nazi-occupied France to retrieve vital information from an informant named Adam. Adam is in Paris under tight Gestapo security (the Naziâ€™s official secret police). Gallatin contacts Adam through a Nazi deserter called â€œMouseâ€�. He slips a note in Adams pocket that informs Adam to go to an opera at the third act, so Gallatin can receive the information. Unfortunately, the Gestapo had followed Adam and shoot him in the head just after the information was disclosed to Michael. Michael escapes by faking suicide using cyanide; he doesnâ€™t swallow the pill. This fake-out allots him time to turn into a werewolf and he kills the fleeing Gestapo. Gallatin and Mouse must make their way east to Berlin, the heart of the Nazis lair, in an attempt to foil a top-secret Nazi plan, â€œIron Fistâ€�.
