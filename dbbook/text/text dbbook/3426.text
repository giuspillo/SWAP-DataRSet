Explanation of the novel's title
The title of the book comes from an ancient Egyptian tale about warring princes Apophis [1] and Sekenenre [2] , wherein Apophis sends Sekenenre a message: "The roaring of the hippopotami in your pools prevents me from sleeping! Hunt them and kill them, that I may rest." There are also several references to the goddess Taueret , who is represented as a hippo.
As Amelia tries to untie the mystery of who is doing what to whom, she and Nefret begin to refer to Riccetti's group as the "Hippopotamus Gang".
