Little Women is a novel by American author Louisa May Alcott (1832–1888). The book was written and set in the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts. It was published in two volumes in 1868 and 1869. The novel follows the lives of four sisters – Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March – and is loosely based on the author's childhood experiences with her three sisters. The first volume, Little Women, was an immediate commercial and critical success, prompting the composition of the book's second volume, entitled Good Wives, which was also successful. Both books were first published as a single volume entitled Little Women in 1880. Alcott followed Little Women with two sequels, also featuring the March sisters: Little Men (1871) and Jo's Boys (1886). Little Women was a fiction novel for girls that veered from the normal writings for children, especially girls, at the time. Little Women has three major themes:” domesticity, work, and true love. All of them are interdependent and each is necessary to the achievement of a heroine’s individual identity. ” Little Women itself “has been read as a romance or as a quest, or both. It has been read as a family drama that validates virtue over wealth. ” Little Women has been read “as a means of escaping that life by women who knew its gender constraints only too well. ” Alcott “combines many conventions of the sentimental novel with crucial ingredients of Romantic children’s fiction, creating a new form of which Little Women is a unique model. ” Elbert argued that within Little Women can be found the first vision of the “American Girl” and that her multiple aspects are embodied in the differing March sisters.
Background
In 1868 Thomas Niles, the publisher of Louisa May Alcott, recommended that she write a book about girls that would have widespread appeal. [8] At first she resisted, preferring to publish a collection of her short stories. Niles pressed her to write the girls' book first, aided by her father Bronson March, who also urged her to do so. [9]
In May 1868, Alcott wrote in her journal: "Niles, partner of Roberts, asked me to write a girl's book. I said I'd try." [10] Alcott set her novel in an imaginary Orchard House modeled on her own residence of the same name, where she wrote the novel. [8] She later recalled that she did not think she could write a successful book for girls and did not enjoy writing it. [11] "I plod away," she wrote in her diary, "although I don't enjoy this sort of things." [12] Scholars classify Little Women as an autobiographical or semi-autobiographical novel. [13] [14]
By June Alcott had sent the first dozen chapters to Niles, and both agreed these were dull. But Niles' niece Lillie Almy read them and said she enjoyed them. [15] The completed manuscript was shown to several girls, who agreed it was "splendid". Alcott wrote, "they are the best critics, so I should definitely be satisfied." [12] She wrote Little Women â€œin record time for money,â€� [16] but the book's immediate success surprised both her and her publisher. [17]
According to literary critic Sarah Elbert, when using the term â€œlittle womenâ€�, Alcott was drawing on its Dickensian meaning; it represented the period in a young woman's life where childhood and elder childhood were "overlapping" young womanhood. Each of the March sister heroines had a harrowing "experience" that alerted her and the reader that "childhood innocence" was of the past, and "the inescapable woman problemâ€� was all that remained. [16] Other views suggest the title was meant to highlight the inferiority of women as compared to men, or, alternatively, describe the lives of simple people, "unimportant" in the social sense. [18]
Inspiration and characters
Alcott was often inspired by familiar elements for her books. The characters in Little Women are recognizably drawn from family members and friends. [4] Her married sister Anna was Meg, the family beauty. Lizzie, Alcott's beloved sister who died at the age of twenty-three, was the model for Beth, and May, Alcott's strong-willed sister, was portrayed as Amy, whose silly affectations cause her occasional downfalls. [4] Alcott portrayed herself as Jo. In her life, she readily corresponded with readers who addressed her as "Miss March" or "Jo," without correcting them. [19] [20] Alcott's portrayal is idealized; for instance, Mr. March is portrayed as a hero of the American Civil War , a gainfully employed chaplain and, presumably, a source of inspiration to the women of the family. He is absent for most of the novel. [21] In contrast, Bronson Alcott was very present in his family's household, due in part to his inability to find steady work. While he espoused many of the educational principles touted by the March family, he was loud and dictatorial. His lack of financial independence was a source of humiliation to his wife and daughters. [21] The March family is portrayed living in genteel penury, but the Alcott family, dependent on an improvident, impractical father, suffered real poverty and occasional hunger. [22] Scholars who came across the diaries of Louisa Alcott's mother, however, have surmised that Little Women was also heavily inspired by Abigail Alcott's own life. [23]
Characters
Margaret "Meg" March Brooke
Sixteen at the opening of the book, Meg is the oldest sister. She is referred to as a beauty, and runs the household when her mother is absent. Meg fulfills expectations for women of the time; from the start, she is already a nearly perfect "little woman". As such, Meg is based in the domestic household; she does not have significant employment or activities outside of it. [24] Prior to her marriage, while still living at home, she often lectures her younger sisters to ensure they grow to embody the title of "little women". [25]
Meg is employed as a governess for the Kings, a wealthy local family. Meg marries John Brooke, the tutor of their neighbor, Laurie Laurence. They have twins, Margaret "Daisy" and John "Demi" Brooke. The sequel, Little Men, suggests that Meg had a second daughter, Josephine Josy Brooke.[ citation needed ]
Critics have portrayed Meg as lacking in independence, relying entirely on her husband and â€œisolated in her little cottage with two small children.â€� [26] From this perspective, Meg is seen as the compliant daughter who does not â€œattain Alcottâ€™s ideal womanhoodâ€� of equality. According to critic Sarah Elbert, â€œdemocratic domesticity requires maturity, strength, and above all a secure identity that Meg lacks.â€� [26] Others believe that Alcott does not intend to belittle Meg for her ordinary life, and portrays her in loving details, suffused in a sentimental light.[ citation needed ]
Josephine "Jo" March Bhaer
The principal character, Jo, is a strong and willful young woman, struggling to subdue her strong personality. Her lack of success in this renders her more realistic and contributes to the charm she has for readers. [27] The second-oldest of four sisters, Josephine March is the boyish one; her father has referred to her as his "son Jo," and her best friend and neighbor Laurie Laurence (male), sometimes calls her "my dear fellow."
Jo has a "hot" temper that often leads her into trouble. With the help of her own misguided sense of humor, her sister Beth, and her mother, she works on controlling it.
Jo loves literature, both reading and writing. She composes plays for her sisters to perform and writes short stories. She initially rejects the idea of marriage and romance, feeling that it would break up her family and separate her from the sisters she adores. While pursuing a literary career in New York City, she meets and begins to love Friederich Bhaer, a German professor, as an equal partner. â€œThey decide to share lifeâ€™s burdens just as they shared the load of bundles on their shopping expedition.â€� [28]
Jo rejects Laurie to marry Professor Bhaer, who is much older than she, believing him better suited to her. "The crucial first point is that the choice is hers, its quirkiness another sign of her much-prized individuality.â€� [29] â€œBhaer has all the qualities Bronson Alcott lacked: warmth, intimacy, and a tender capacity for expressing his affectionâ€”the feminine attributes Alcott admired and hoped men could acquire in a rational, feminist world. They have two sons, Robin 'Rob' Bhaer and Teddy Bhaer.â€� [28] Jo also writes the first part of Little Women during the second portion of the novel. According to Elbert, "her narration signals a successfully completed adolescence.â€� [7]
Jo March's unconventional behavior, her refusal to adapt to the gender stereotypes of her time have caused her to be described as a sort of "early feminist". [30] Some scholars have interpreted Jo's rebellious behavior as "androgynous nonconformity," which decries the character's discomfort with traditional gender identity. [31] Critic Jan Susina interpreted Jo's discomfort with marriage, her rejection of Laurie, and rejection of traditional gender values as proof that Alcott wrote an "anti-male text". [32]
Elizabeth "Beth" March
Beth, thirteen when the story starts, is described as shy, gentle and musical. She is the only March sister without failings or character flaws. [33] As her sisters grow up, they begin to leave home, but Beth has no desire to leave her house or family. She's especially close to Jo: when Beth develops scarlet fever after visiting the Hummels, Jo does most of the nursing and rarely leaves her side. Though Beth recovers, her health is permanently weakened, and she eventually dies young.
As she grows, Beth begins to realize that her time with her loved ones is coming to an end. Finally, the family accepts that Beth will not live much longer. They make a special room for her, filled with all the things she loves best: her kittens, piano, father's books, Amy's sketches, and her beloved dolls. She is never idle; she knits and sews things for the children who pass by on their way to and from school. But eventually she puts down her sewing needle, saying it grew "heavy." Beth's death has a strong effect on her sisters, especially Jo, who resolves to live her life with more consideration and care for everyone.
The main loss during Little Women is the death of beloved Beth. Her â€œself-sacrifice is ultimately the greatest in the novel. She gives up her life knowing that it has had only private, domestic meaning.â€� [34]
Amy Curtis March Laurence
Amy is the youngest sister and baby of the family, aged twelve when the story begins. Interested in art, she is described as a "regular snow-maiden" with curly golden hair and blue eyes, "pale and slender" and "always carrying herself" like a proper young lady. She is the artist of the family. [35] Often "petted" because she is the youngest, Amy can behave in a vain and self-centered way. [36] Amy is the least inclined of the sisters to sacrifice and self-denial. Critic Martha Saxton observes the author was never fully at ease with Amy's moral development and her success in life seemed relatively accidental. [36] Because of her selfishness and attachment to material things, Amy has been described as the least likable of the three sisters, but she is also the only one who strives to excel at art for self-expression, in contrast to Jo, who writes for financial gain. [37]
Additional characters
Margaret "Marmee" March
The girls' mother and head of household while her husband is away. She engages in charitable works and attempts to guide her girls' morals and to shape their characters, usually through experiments. She once confesses to Jo that her temper is as volatile as Jo's, but that she has learned to control it. [38] Somewhat modeled after the Author's own mother, she is the fulcrum around which the girls' lives unfold as they grow. [39]
Robert "Father" March
Formerly wealthy, the father is portrayed as having helped friends who could not repay a debt, resulting in his family's genteel poverty. A scholar and a minister, he serves as a chaplain in the Union Army during the Civil War and is wounded in December 1862.
Hannah Mullet
The March family maid and cook, their only servant. She is of Irish descent and very dear to the Family. She is treated more like a member of the family than a servant.
Aunt Josephine March
Mr. March's aunt, a rich widow. Somewhat temperamental and prone to being judgmental, she disapproves of the family's poverty, their charitable work, and their general disregard for the more superficial aspects of society's ways. Her vociferous disapproval of Meg's impending engagement to the impoverished Mr. Brooke becomes the proverbial "last straw" that actually causes Meg to accept his proposal. She appears to be strict and cold hearted, but deep down, she's really quite soft-hearted. She dies near the end of the book, and Jo and Frederich Bhaer turn her estate into a school for boys.
Uncle and Aunt Carrol
Sister and brother-in-law of Mr. March. They take Amy to Europe with them, where Uncle Carrol frequently tries to be like an English gentleman.
Theodore "Laurie" Laurence
He is a rich young man, older than Jo but younger than Meg. Laurie is the "boy next door" to the March family, and has an overprotective paternal grandfather, Mr. Laurence. After eloping with an Italian pianist, Laurie's father was disowned by his parents. Both he and Laurie's mother died young, and the boy Laurie was taken in by his grandfather. Preparing to enter Harvard, Laurie is being tutored by John Brooke. He is described as attractive and charming, with black eyes, brown skin, and curly black hair. He later falls in love with Amy and they marry; they have one child, a sickly little girl named after Beth: Elizabeth "Bess" Laurence.Sometimes Jo calls Laurie "Teddy". Though Alcott did not make Laurie as multidimensional as the female characters, she partly baseds him on Ladislas Wisniewski, a young polish Ã©migrÃ© she had befriended, and Alf Whitman, a friend from Lawrence, Kansas . [4] [36] [40] According to Jan Susina, the portrayal of Laurie as a minor character, an observer but never a protagonist, always at the periphery of the March sisters, is evidence that the novel is unfavorable to men and that Alcott did not really care for her male characters. [32]
James Laurence
Laurie's grandfather and a wealthy neighbor of the Marches. Lonely in his mansion, and often at odds with his high-spirited grandson, he finds comfort in becoming a benefactor to the Marches. He protects the March sisters while their parents are away. He was a friend to Mrs. March's father, and admires their charitable works. He develops a special, tender friendship with Beth, who reminds him of his late granddaughter. He gives Beth the girl's piano.
John Brooke
During his employment with the Laurences as a tutor to Laurie, he falls in love with Meg. He accompanies Mrs. March to Washington D.C. when her husband is ill with pneumonia. When Laurie leaves for college, Brooke continues his employment with Mr. Laurence as an assistant. When Aunt March overhears Meg rejecting John's declaration of love, she threatens Meg with disinheritance because she suspects that Brooke is only interested in Meg's future prospects. Eventually Meg admits her feelings to Brooke, they defy Aunt March (who ends up accepting the marriage), and they are engaged. Brooke serves in the Union Army for a year and is invalided home after being wounded. Brooke marries Meg a few years later when the war has ended and she has turned twenty. Brooke was modeled after John Pratt, her sister Anna's husband. [41]
Fred Vaughan
A Harvard friend of Laurie's who, in Europe, courts Amy. Rivalry with the much richer Fred for Amy's love inspires the dissipated Laurie to pull himself together and become more worthy of her. Amy will eventually reject Fred, knowing she does not love him and deciding not to marry out of ambition. [42]
Minor Characters
The Hummels
A poor German family consisting of a widowed mother and six children. Marmee and the girls help them by bringing food, firewood, blankets and other comforts. Three of the children die of scarlet fever and Beth contracts the disease while caring for them.
