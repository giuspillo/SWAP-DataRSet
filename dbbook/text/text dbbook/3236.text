The Oxford Companion to Wine (OCW) is a book in the series of Oxford Companions published by Oxford University Press. The book provides an alphabetically arranged reference to wine, compiled and edited by Jancis Robinson, with contributions by several wine writers including Hugh Johnson, Michael Broadbent, and James Halliday, and experts such as viticulturist Richard Smart and oenologist Pascal Ribéreau-Gayon. The contract for the first edition was signed in 1988, and after five years of writing it was published in 1994. The second edition was published in 1999 and the third in 2006. The third edition contains nearly 4,000 entries over about 800 pages with contributions of 167 people. Entries for individuals are limited by the strict criteria of "a long track record" and "global significance"; hence French worldwide consulting oenologist Michel Rolland and even Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev have entries, while California oenologist Helen Turley is omitted. Also, there is no entry for Jancis Robinson herself. Eric Asimov of The New York Times has noted that with the wine world's increasing rate of evolution, "this encyclopedic work keeps pace with new information on issues like climate change, biodynamic viticulture and globalization, and emerging wine regions like Canada and eastern Europe". Having received several awards, including the André Simon Memorial Award and the Glenfiddich Award, it has been described as "the most useful wine book ever published", and "the one essential book for any wine-lover".
