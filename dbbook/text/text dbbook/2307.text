Teranesia is a 1999 science fiction novel by Greg Egan. The novel won the 2000 Ditmar Award for Best Novel but Egan declined to accept the award.
Plot summary
The novel explores an unusual connection between molecular genetics and quantum computing , with criticism of some of what it considers the excesses of postmodernism and feminism . However, most of the novel focuses on future south-east Asian politics (Egan criticizes Indonesian imperialism and Australian treatment of refugees ), repressed childhood guilt , evolutionary biology and academic life. As often in Egan's books, there is some focus on sexuality : this time the lead character is gay , rather than one of the more exotic alternatives in other novels.
