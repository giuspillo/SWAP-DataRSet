Book's description
The voice of the night can transform childhood fantasy into terrifying reality. If you listen to the voice, you may never see the dawn again! Colin Jacobs is a shy, awkward, bookish fourteen-year-old. His only real companions are those from the science fiction stories he loves. But his life changes when Roy Borden, the most popular kid in town, becomes his 'blood brother'. There's only one problem. Roy has a secret â€” a secret so terrible that Colin can hardly imagine it. By the time he comes to face the truth, it's almost too late. His own life is in danger â€” and no one will believe him...
