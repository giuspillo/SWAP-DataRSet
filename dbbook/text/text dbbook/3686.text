Development
Miyuki-chan in Wonderland was developed by Clamp â€”the all-female, manga artist team consisting of Satsuki Igarashi , Mokona , Tsubaki Nekoi , and Nanase Ohkawa . [1] Ohkawa conceived the concept of Miyuki-chan in Wonderland, which was supposed to serve as the first chapter. [2] The team, however, decided to continue with the concept, as Ohkawa was fond of it and Mokona enjoyed illustrating the characters. [2] The protagonist was illustrated with her school uniform, as that provided the team with more fan service opportunities during action scenes. [2] In retrospective, the team felt that the manga acted as a showcase for Mokona's "sexy, female character designs", writing: "It was fun, but a little hentai ." [2]

Reception and legacy
Miyuki-chan in Wonderland received a range of critical reaction. In Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy (2009), Eden Lee Lackner wrote that the manga's notability stems from "how it plays with textual boundaries"; for example, Miyuki travels through Clamp's adaptation of the fictional worlds of Alice in Wonderland and X. [3] According to her, Miyuki's travels to X land serves as "characteristic" of Clamp's intersection of its characters and narratives from its different works. [3] Dani Cavallaro in Clamp in Context (2012) stated that Miyuki-chan in Wonderland's "most memorable" aspect comes from the sense of artistic "creative enjoyment". [12] Writing for Sequential Tart, Sheena McNeil greatly enjoyed the manga, praising it as entertaining "fluff". [13] Patrick King of Animefringe wrote that the illustrations contributed the most appeal to the plotless manga, with the inclusion of a bonus section and colored OVA concept-art pages praised as well. [14] In contrast, Katherine Dacey, the former senior manga editor for PopCultureShock, described the manga as "the nadir of this talented quartetâ€™s work" in her list of the ten worst manga. [15] According to her, the "inane" short stories served as "just a pretext for CLAMP to draw scantily-clad beauties engaging in vaguely naughty behavior (usually making a pass at the vaguely horrified Miyuki or inviting her to play strip poker)." [15] Mason Templar, writing in Manga: The Complete Guide (2007), similarly reviewed the manga, commenting that it was best viewed as an artbook. [16] Erica Friedman, the founder of Yuricon , a lesbian-themed convention, and ALC Publishing , wrote that the settings were "loosely based on Lewis Carrollâ€™s iconic works, games and Clampâ€™s own work." According to her, the manga lacked emotion and a true depiction of lesbians, only showing "fictitious female beings groping a fictitious female character". [17]
The anime adaptation also received a range of reviews. Anime News Network 's Christopher Macdonald recommended it as nonsensical entertainment, describing it as Clamp's tribute to Alice in Wonderland and its sequel Through the Looking Glass (1871). [18] McNeil praised it as nicely animated entertainment, though it lacked developed characters and a plot. [19] In his review of the anime adaptation, King concluded: "It's simply a showcase of some cute and sexy animation designed by CLAMP, no more, no less." [20] He noted the absence of an English-language dub . [20] Chris Beveridge of Mania Entertainment praised the character designs and voice acting, rating the anime C- . [11] Another reviewer for Sequential Tart expressed her lukewarm feelings towards the anime, and wrote that it might appeal to fans of Clamp or art films. [21] While praising the visuals and audio as helping to create a surreal atmosphere, Raphael See of THEM Anime Reviews, in contrast, wrote that the effect was ruined by the sexual nature of the plot; he recommended Dreams (1990) or Robot Carnival (1987) instead. [22] In The Anime Encyclopedia : A Guide to Japanese Animation since 1917 (2001), Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy unfavorably reviewed the anime, describing it as "pointlessly kinky." [9]
Miyuki has appeared in other works by Clamp. She appears in the video collection Clamp in Wonderland (1994), [12] and makes a cameo appearance in the backgrounds of the fantasy manga series Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle (2003â€“2009). [16]
