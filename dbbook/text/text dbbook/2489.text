The Inimitable Jeeves is a semi-novel collecting Jeeves stories by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom by Herbert Jenkins, London, on May 17, 1923, and in the United States by George H. Doran, New York on September 28, 1923, under the title Jeeves.
Overview
The novel combined 11 previously published stories, of which the first six and the last were split in two, to make a book of 18 chapters. It is now often printed in 11 chapters, mirroring the original stories.
All the stories had previously appeared in The Strand Magazine in the UK, between December 1921 and November 1922, except for one, " Jeeves and the Chump Cyril ", which had appeared in the Strand in August 1918. That story had appeared in the Saturday Evening Post (US) in June 1918. All the other stories appeared in Cosmopolitan in the US between December 1921 and December 1922.
This was the second collection of Jeeves stories, after My Man Jeeves (1919); the next collection would be Carry on, Jeeves , in 1925.
All of the short stories are connected and most of them involve Bertie's friend Bingo Little , who is always falling in love.
