Synopsis
Set in a post-communist fictional country, likely based on Bulgaria , the novel concerns the trial of Stoyo Petkanov, a character judged to be loosely based on Todor Zhivkov , the former communist leader of Bulgaria. As the newly appointed Prosecutor General attempts to ensnare the former dictator with his own totalitarian laws, Petkanov springs a few unwelcome surprises on the court by conducting a formidable defense.
The Times described the book as 'Superbly humane in its moral concerns...an excellent novel'.
