Brief Interviews with Hideous Men (1999) is a collection of 23 short stories by David Foster Wallace. Several of the stories are entitled "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men" and are presented as transcripts of interviews with male subjects. The interviewer's questions are omitted from the transcripts, rendered merely as "Q. " These stories and the rest of the collection are characterized by dark dry humor, alienation, and unconventional sexuality. In 1997 Wallace was awarded the Aga Khan Prize for Fiction by editors of The Paris Review for "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men #6", which had appeared in the magazine and appears as "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men #20" in the collection. Twelve of the "Interviews" were adapted into a stage play (Hideous Men) by Dylan McCullough in 2000, marking the first theatrical adaptation of any of Wallace's works. McCullough directed the premiere at the New York International Fringe Festival in August 2000. Actor John Krasinski of The Office has adapted and directed a film version on the "Brief Interviews" stories that was released in 2009. Julianne Nicholson plays Sara Quinn, the interviewer unnamed in the stories.
