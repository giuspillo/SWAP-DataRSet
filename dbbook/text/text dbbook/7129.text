Dollar goes about the work of meeting local down-on-their-luck farmers to manipulate them into selling out. [3] He bases his search in the fictional town of Woolybucket, named after the real tree species, Sideroxylon lanuginosum . [2]
There he gets a job at Woolybucket's Old Dog restaurant, and moves into an old bunkhouse in local historian LaVon Fronk's ranch.
