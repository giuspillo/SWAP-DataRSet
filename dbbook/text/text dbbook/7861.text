The Happy Hocky Family is a children's book by author and illustrator Lane Smith. Written in a style similar to the Dick and Jane books, it tells a series of short, typically single page, stories about the Hocky family, which includes the two parents, three children, their dog, and occasionally their cousin. The book is not a typical picture book in that the humor in it tends to be slightly dark and sarcastic, as in the works of Jon Scieszka. A sequel, The Happy Hocky Family Moves to the Country!, was released in 2002.
