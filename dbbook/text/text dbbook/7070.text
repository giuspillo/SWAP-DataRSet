Rachel's Tears: The Spiritual Journey of Columbine Martyr Rachel Scott is a non-fiction book about Rachel Scott, one of the victims of the Columbine High School massacre. Written by her parents, including her journal entries, it is part of a nation-wide school outreach program and ministry. They present Rachel as being killed for her Christian affirmation.
History
Darrell Scott traveled around the United States to promote the book. Scott said that, during his travels he heard many stories about school death threats and that this compelled him to spread the message of his daughter. Scott said the number was "by far, more than are reported in the media". [3]
Reception
Caitlin M. Foyt of Central Michigan Life said that as a sixth grader, when she read the book, she "believed in it. She believed in herself and in her faith and I believed in her story." [4] After the publication of a USA Today article titled "10 years later, the real story behind Columbine" which stated that the events did not happen, Foyt said "The fact that itâ€™s not true makes me feel cheated and lied to. Misinterpretation of the truth on any scale has consequences, even 10 years down the road." [4]
