He calls in the bow Street Runners when the family diamonds are stolen.
(The name Cedric is one of Miss Heyer's rare historical errors, having first been used by Sir Walter Scott in the novel Ivanhoe , published in 1820 â€” well after the period of this book â€” in mistake for the actual Saxon name Cerdic.)
