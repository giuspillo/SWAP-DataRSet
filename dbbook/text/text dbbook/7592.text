The Rubber Band is the third Nero Wolfe detective novel by Rex Stout. Prior to its publication in 1936 by Farrar & Rinehart, Inc. , the novel was serialized in six issues of The Saturday Evening Post (February 29–April 4, 1936). Appearing in one 1960 paperback edition titled To Kill Again, The Rubber Band was also collected in the omnibus volume Five of a Kind (Viking 1961).
Plot introduction
You know, Mr. Goodwin, this house represents the most insolent denial of female rights the mind of man has ever conceived. No woman in it from top to bottom, but the routine is faultless, the food is perfect, and the sweeping and dusting are impeccable. I have never been a housewife, but I canâ€™t overlook this challenge. Iâ€™m going to marry Mr. Wolfe, and I know a girl that will be just the thing for you, and of course our friends will be in and out a good deal. This place needs some upsetting.
â€” Clara Fox, pouring Archieâ€™s after-dinner coffee in the dining room while wearing his yellow dressing gown in The Rubber Band, chapter 12
Archie books two new clients on the same day, and before the day is over Wolfe has to choose which to keep and there are more than two crimes to untangle. The client he keeps in the end is a beautiful young woman, but it's Wolfe who reads her Hungarian poetry, not Archie.
The novel introduces Lieutenant Rowcliff , not one of the NYPD 's finest (in the opinion not only of Wolfe but Inspector Cramer ). Rowcliff's search for Clara Fox in the brownstone earns Wolfe's enmity, which lasts until the final Wolfe novel in 1975. In addition, the novel contains the first documented death to occur in Wolfe's office.
Plot summary
Rico Tomaso illustrated the six-part serialized printing of The Rubber Band for The Saturday Evening Post (February 29â€“April 4, 1936)
During Nero Wolfe's daily exercise â€” a game of darts â€” Archie amuses himself with irritating Wolfe by reading aloud a newspaper article about the Marquis of Clivers, a British nobleman who has recently arrived in America on official government business. Later, Archie meets with Anthony Perry, president of the Seaboard Products Corporation, who is concerned that one of his employees, Clara Fox, is being unjustly accused of theft. A package containing $30,000 held for a client by Ramsey Muir, the company's senior vice president, has gone missing, and Muir is accusing Fox. Despite the evidence pointing to Fox, Perry hopes that Wolfe will be able to clear her.
During their discussion, Archie and Perry are interrupted by Harlan Scovil, who has recently arrived in New York City from Wyoming and is part of a group who have a later appointment with Wolfe. At one point Scovil seems to mistake Perry for another man, Mike Walsh. Before Archie can attend to Scovil, he is summoned to Perryâ€™s company offices, where Muir is threatening to call the police to arrest Fox. Archie's preliminary investigations turn up little, and he arrives back to the brownstone to learn that Scovil has left, summoned away by a telephone call.
The anonymous woman who made the second appointment arrives, and Archie is surprised to discover that it is none other than Clara Fox. She has brought with her another woman, Hilda Lindquist, and the actual Mike Walsh. Fox and her companions wish to hire Wolfe to recover a sum of money they believe is owed to them by the Marquis of Clivers. In Silver City, Nevada during the days of the Wild West, a group of men calling themselves the Rubber Bandâ€”among them Walsh, Scovil and the fathers of Clara and Hildaâ€”helped the Marquis, then called George Rowley, escape a lynching in return for a share of the Marquisâ€™ substantial inheritance. Although Clara's father was later killed in action on the Western Front during the First World War , he told the tale to his wife after a brief encounter with the Marquis, then a British general, in the hopes that she might be able find some way of claiming their rightful share of the inheritance from Rowley. Clara has subsequently devoted her life to this pursuit.
The discussion is interrupted by a police detective who brings the news that Harlan Scovil has been murdered. In his pockets were found the contact details for the Marquis of Clivers, prompting the police to suspect him of blackmail. Wolfe also learns from Fred Durkin that the police have found the missing $30,000 in Fox's car, and a warrant has been issued for her arrest. Once the policeman has left, Wolfe questions Fox concerning the stolen money and the murder; satisfied as to her honesty and innocence on both matters, he accepts her as his client, and persuades her to remain in the brownstone. During their discussion, Fox admits that she has already approached the Marquis to try and persuade him to honour his arrangement, but was dismissed by him. Mike Walsh rejects Wolfeâ€™s offer of protection and storms out.
Having tracked Fox to the brownstone, two police detectives attempt to force their way in to apprehend her, but are ejected by Archie. Wolfe contacts the Marquis regarding the Rubber Band's request for their rightful share of his inheritance and in response, the Marquis sends his nephew, Francis Horrocks, to discuss the matter. Horrocks, however, appears more interested in the personal business he is there on â€” to see Clara Fox, with whom he has developed a romantic attachment and who called him from the brownstone earlier. Hot on Horrocks' heels are the police, represented by Lt. Gilbert Rowcliff, who have a search warrant to enter the brownstone and arrest Fox. Wolfe is outraged by Rowcliff's impertinence, but is forced to allow the police to search the premises. Fox, however, cannot be found, and once the police have left Wolfe reveals that he concealed her in the orchid rooms.
Wolfe receives a visit from the Marquis of Clivers himself, who reveals that he has already paid his debt to the Rubber Band. Several years before Rubber Coleman, the leader of the group, approached him with documentation supporting their claim and, upon receiving the money, provided him with a receipt apparently signed by all of the members of the band. The next day, Archie receives a phone call from Mike Walsh claiming that he has found Rubber Coleman, only for the call to be ended by a loud noise that sounds like a gunshot. He soon learns that Walsh has been found dead at the building site where he works as a night watchmen â€” and none other than the Marquis of Clivers was found standing over the body. Wolfe arranges to contact Victor Lindquist, seemingly the only surviving member of the Rubber Band, and warns him to be prepared for any attempts on his life.
A party including Inspector Cramer, Police Commissioner Hombert and District Attorney Skinner arrive at the brownstone, demanding that Wolfe share what he has learnt about the case with them. Wolfe produces Clara, asserting that she has been in the brownstone since the affair began and is not responsible for Walsh's death. The officials interrogate her, but are unable to determine anything that indicates her guilt in the affair. The next morning, Archie is surprised to find Wolfe apparently playing with rubber bands in the orchid rooms. After sending Saul Panzer to the drugstore down the street on an errand Archie is not privy to, Wolfe has him contact the Marquis of Clivers and summon everyone, including Ramsey Muir and Anthony Perry, to his office.
Once everyone has arrived, Wolfe enters his office with the Marquis, who recognises Anthony Perry instantly â€” he is Rubber Coleman. Wolfe reveals that Perry, or rather Coleman, swindled the money from the other members of the Rubber Band and used it to fund his numerous business enterprises, only to come across an advertisement Clara Fox placed in the papers seeking information the Rubber Band. He hired her to keep her close, and attempted to discourage her from pursuing her claim but framed her for the theft of the $30,000 when he was unable to do so. Intending to hire Wolfe to cover his tracks and throw suspicion off himself, he had the misfortune to be recognised by Scovil at Wolfe's office. Coleman murdered Scovil to prevent him from remembering who he was, and then murdered Walsh after Walsh tracked him down, staging the phone call with the use of a rubber band to simulate the gun shot that killed Walsh.
Perry, cornered, attempts to shoot Wolfe but is gunned down by the Marquis and Archie before he can do so. Having proven Clara's innocence, Wolfe negotiates with the Marquis to claim her and Lindquist's fair share of his inheritance. Guilt-ridden by the deaths she believes have been caused by her quest, Clara attempts to turn it down, but is persuaded to accept it by Wolfe.
The unfamiliar word
"Nero Wolfe talks in a way that no human being on the face of the earth has ever spoken, with the possible exception of Rex Stout after he had a gin and tonic," said Michael Jaffe , executive producer of the A&E TV series, A Nero Wolfe Mystery . [1] Nero Wolfe's erudite vocabulary is one of the hallmarks of the character. Examples of unfamiliar words â€” or unfamiliar uses of words that some would otherwise consider familiar â€” are found throughout the corpus, often in the give-and-take between Wolfe and Archie.
Usufruct , chapter 5. Before taking Clara Fox as his client, Wolfe ascertains her level of personal involvement with her employers:
Wolfe sighed. "Really, Miss Fox, we are wasting time that may be valuable. Tell me, I beg you, about Mr. Perry and Mr. Muir. Mr. Muir hinted this afternoon that Mr. Perry is enjoying the usufructs of gallantry. Is that true?"
"Of course not." She frowned, and then smiled. "Calling it that, it doesn't sound bad at all, does it? But he isn't."
Necromancer, chapter 6. Telling his client that no sorcery is responsible for his conclusions, Wolfe says, "I am not a necromancer, Miss Fox."
Acarpous, chapter 13. Wolfe encounters another twist in the case while speaking to Lord Clivers:
He looked at me. "Confound it, Archie. I have you to thank for this acarpous entanglement."
It was a new one, but I got the idea.
Weltschmerz , chapter 15. Archie returns to the office to find that Wolfe is in conference with himself:
I would have tried some bulldozing if I thought he was merely dreaming of stuffed quail or pickled pigs' feet, but his lips were moving a little so I knew he was working. I fooled around my desk, went over Johnny's diagrams again in connection with an idea that had occurred to me, checked over Horstmann's reports and entered them in the records, reread the Gazette scoop on the affair at 55th Street, and aggravated myself into such a condition of uselessness that finally, at eleven o'clock sharp, I exploded, "If this keeps up another ten minutes I'll get Weltschmerz!"
Wolfe opened his eyes. "Where in the name of heaven did you get that?"
I threw up my hands. He shut his eyes again.
Reviews and commentary
Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime â€” In the manner of its time, this early tale is long and brings up past history. ... It starts in New York City with a young woman who is accused of stealing $30,000 from the office where she works. Nero is voluble and Archie in good form. Despite complexity, the tidying up is neat and satisfactory. [2]
John McAleer, Rex Stout: A Biography â€” Reviewers were enthusiastic. Yale's perdurable William Lyon Phelps called it "a work of art." Christopher Morley said: "The whole affair is brilliantly handled and gives complete satisfaction." Isaac Anderson [The New York Times] thought it "the peak of his achievements." To Will Cuppy , Wolfe was "the Falstaff of detectives." [3]
Vincent Starrett â€” One of his most brilliant and exhilarating performances. Few better mystery stories have been written in our time. [4]
Robert Van Gelder, The New York Times (April 17, 1936) â€” Another crackerjack Nero Wolfe story in which a Western promise bobs up later to cause murders and place a beautiful lady in peril. Told by that inimitable Watson, Archie Goodwin. You can't go wrong on this for entertainment.
The Washington Post â€” Among the best Wolfe-Archie Goodwin tales; the whole gang makes an appearance â€” Inspector Cramer, Saul Panzer, etc. â€” and the writing crackles. A good one to start with for readers unfamiliar with America's shrewdest, orchid-growing, fat, stay-at-home detective. [5]
