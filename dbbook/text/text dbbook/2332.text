The Children of Húrin is an epic fantasy novel which forms the completion of a tale by J. R. R. Tolkien. He wrote the original version of the story in the late 1910s, revised it several times later, but did not complete it before his death in 1973. His son, Christopher Tolkien, edited the manuscripts to form a consistent narrative, and published it in 2007 as an independent work.
Main article: The Silmarillion
The history and descent of the main characters are given as the leading paragraphs of the book, and the back story is elaborated upon in The Silmarillion . It begins five hundred years before the action of the book, when Morgoth , a Vala and the prime evil power, escapes from the Blessed Realm of Valinor to the north-west of Middle-earth. From his fortress of Angband he endeavours to gain control of the whole of Middle-earth, unleashing a war with the Elves that dwell in the land of Beleriand to the south.
However, the Elves manage to stay his assault, and most of their realms remain unconquered; one of the most powerful of these is Doriath , ruled by Thingol . In addition, after some time the Noldorin Elves forsake Valinor and pursue Morgoth to Middle-earth in order to take vengeance upon him. Together with the Sindar of Beleriand, they proceed to lay siege to Angband, and establish new strongholds and realms in Middle-earth, including Hithlum ruled by Fingon , Nargothrond by Finrod Felagund and Gondolin by Turgon .
Three centuries pass, during which the first Men appear in Beleriand. These are the Edain , descendants of those Men who have rebelled against the rule of Morgoth's servants and journeyed westward. Most of the Elves welcome them, and they are given fiefs throughout Beleriand. The House of BÃ«or rules over the land of Ladros , the Folk of Haleth retreat to the forest of Brethil , and the lordship of Dor-lÃ³min is granted to the House of Hador . Later, other Men enter Beleriand, the Easterlings , many of whom are in secret league with Morgoth.
Eventually Morgoth manages to break the Siege of Angband in the Battle of Sudden Flame . The House of BÃ«or is destroyed and the Elves and Edain suffer heavy losses; however, many realms remain unconquered, including Dor-lÃ³min , where the lordship has passed to HÃºrin Thalion .

(November 2012)
HÃºrin, lord of Men of the house of Hador in Dor-lÃ³min, marries Morwen Eledhwen and they have two children, a son TÃºrin and a daughter, Lalaith . TÃºrin grows to boyhood. A kind woodworker in HÃºrin's employ, Sador , becomes his friend.
In the disastrous defeat of the Battle of Unnumbered Tears HÃºrin is taken to Angband , stronghold of Morgoth . Morgoth places a curse on HÃºrin's family whereby evil will befall them for their whole lives, and imprisons HÃºrin high on mount Thangorodrim.
At Morgoth's command, the allied Easterlings overrun Hithlum and Dor-lÃ³min. Morwen, fearing her son's capture, sends TÃºrin to the Elven realm of Doriath for safety. Morwen gives birth to Nienor . In Doriath, TÃºrin is taken as foster-son by King Thingol and becomes a mighty warrior. At one point during his life with Beleg on the fringes of the forest TÃºrin returns to Thingol's court, where his wild and unkempt appearance draws the scorn of Saeros , a proud Elf who believes that Men should be kept out of Doriath. After Saeros hurls a snide insult directed at TÃºrin's mother and sister, TÃºrin throws a dish in Saeros's face, injuring him. Saeros, angry over what happened in the hall, attacks TÃºrin from behind in the woods the next day. TÃºrin overpowers him, however, and strips him, forcing him to run naked through the woods shouting for help as TÃºrin pursues him. The Elf Mablung follows them, crying for TÃºrin to stop, but TÃºrin continues chasing Saeros until the terrified Elf attempts to jump a gorge too wide for him, and falls, dying in the water below. Mablung, having witnessed only the chase through the woods and not Saeros's original assault upon TÃºrin, believes that Saeros was humiliated without provocation and wishes to bring TÃºrin back to trial in Doriath. TÃºrin's pride restrains him from either correcting the misunderstanding or submitting to trial, and he chooses rather to leave Doriath and become an outcast.
Thingol holds an absentee trial for TÃºrin, and as the only evidence is that TÃºrin humiliated Saeros without cause, Thingol is on the verge of outlawing him from Doriath until he should choose to return and ask for pardon. Just as the King's judgment is about to be put into effect, however, Beleg rushes in late accompanied by an Elf-maid named Nellas, who witnessed Saeros's assault upon TÃºrin from her vantage point in a tree. With Nellas's evidence taken into account, Thingol grants TÃºrin a full pardon, and Beleg leaves Doriath to find TÃºrin and bid him to return to Doriath.
TÃºrin meanwhile joins a band of outlaws in the wild, the Gaurwaith or "Wolf-folk", of which he later becomes the captain.Beleg traces the signs of TÃºrin's band, gathering news of TÃºrin from those who had seen or heard of him, but the outlaws repeatedly throw off his pursuit.
After a year in the wild Beleg succeeds in overtaking the band at a time when TÃºrin is absent. Mistrusting Elves in general and having become cruel through long lives of self-centered crime, the men mistreat Beleg in an attempt to elicit any information he might possess. After being tortured by the lawless gang for several days, Beleg is on the verge of death when TÃºrin returns. TÃºrin is horrified to see his friend so maltreated by his own men, and while tending Beleg TÃºrin vows to forsake the evil and cruel habits he has fallen into while among the lawless men, recognizing that his band's senseless cruelty towards the innocent Beleg can be traced back to his own lax standards. When Beleg recovers, he is able to deliver to TÃºrin the message of the king's pardon; TÃºrin is torn, but in spite of Beleg's pleas refuses to humble his pride, and will not accept the pardon and return to Doriath. Beleg then departs in order to participate in battles upon the north-marches of Doriath, in spite of TÃºrin's request that Beleg stay by his side.
Some time later, TÃºrin and his men capture MÃ®m the Petty-dwarf , who ransoms his life by leading the band to the caves in the hill of Amon RÃ»dh , where the ancestral home of the Petty-dwarves is hidden. Despite the unfortunate death of MÃ®m's son at the hands of one of TÃºrin's band, MÃ®m grows to respect TÃºrin, and the outlaws set up a permanent base in the caves. In Doriath, Beleg decides against his better judgment to return to his friend, and arrives at Amon RÃ»dh to a loving reception from TÃºrin. The other outlaws resent Beleg's presence, however, and MÃ®m, who had earlier proclaimed his enmity towards the Elves, grows to hate him bitterly. Nevertheless everything proceeds smoothly for a while, the outlaw band gradually increases to a great number (though only the original fifty men are allowed entrance to the hidden caves of the Petty-dwarves), and becomes more daring and successful in the warfare against Morgoth's troops. At length, TÃºrin and Beleg even establish the realm of Dor-CÃºarthol , and word spreads that Beleg and TÃºrin, long unheard-of, have appeared again as the captains of a great host.
However, MÃ®m's hatred towards Beleg eventually reaches a breaking point, and he approaches a band of Orcs with an offer to lead them to the outlaw's headquarters on Amon RÃ»dh, in return for the promise of monetary compensation. The dwarf leads them to the hidden caves, and TÃºrin's company is taken unawares. They retreat to the top of Amon RÃ»dh to defend themselves, but the entire band are eventually killed, excepting Beleg and TÃºrin, whom the Orcs want alive. They bind TÃºrin and carry him off towards Angband, while leaving Beleg wounded and helpless, chained to a rock. MÃ®m approaches him after all the Orcs depart and is on the verge of torturing the Elf to death, when AndrÃ³g , one of the outlaws, who is wounded and had appeared dead, rouses himself enough to drive MÃ®m away and release Beleg before succumbing to his wounds. Beleg remains in Amon RÃ»dh until his own wounds are healed, and then, knowing that TÃºrin is not among the dead and must have been taken captive, follows the company of Orcs.
In pursuit of the Orcs, Beleg comes across a mutilated elf, Gwindor of Nargothrond sleeping in the dread forest of Taur-nu-Fuin. Gwindor had been an Elvish lord before being taken captive and forced to serve in Angband for many years, and Beleg remains with him. They see the Orc company pass by, and entering their camp that night find TÃºrin sleeping, and carry him away from the Orcs. When at a safe distance they stop, and Beleg begins to cut TÃºrin's bonds with his sword Gurthang , which Beleg had been warned was an evil blade which would not stay with him long. The sword slips in his hand and TÃºrin is cut; and TÃºrin, mistaking Beleg in the dark for an Orc who had come to torture him, leaps to his feet and kills Beleg with his own sword. When TÃºrin sees Beleg's face in a flash of lightning and realizes what he has done, he falls into a kind of frenzy, not speaking or weeping, but refusing to leave Beleg's body. In the morning Gwindor is able to bury Beleg, but TÃºrin remains crazed and witless with grief.
Gwindor leads TÃºrin through the wild for months, and TÃºrin remains in a fixed state of grief and guilt, not speaking, but doing only what Gwindor bids him. At length, however, the two reach Eithel Ivrin , where TÃºrin finally weeps for Beleg, and is healed. Having regained his senses, he and Gwindor proceed to Nargothrond, where Gwindor lived before his long imprisonment in Angband. There TÃºrin gains favour with King Orodreth and earns the love of his daughter Finduilas , although she was previously engaged to be married to Gwindor, and TÃºrin does not reciprocate her romantic feelings. After leading the Elves to considerable victories, TÃºrin becomes the chief counsellor of Orodreth and effectively commander of all the forces in Nargothrond. This fuels TÃºrin's pride, and he begins giving extravagant orders which are arrogant and ill-thought-out, and eventually hasten the doom of Nargothrond.
Messengers sent from CÃ­rdan warn TÃºrin to hide Nargothrond from Morgoth, but TÃºrin refused to retract his rash and prideful plans for full-scale battle, and treats the messengers rudely. However, after five years Morgoth sends a great force of Orcs under the command of a dragon , Glaurung , and defeats the army of Nargothrond on the field of Tumhalad , where both Gwindor and Orodreth are killed. Easily crossing over a great bridge which TÃºrin had had built against all counsel, Morgoth's forces sack Nargothrond and capture its citizens while its forces are engaged on the field of battle. TÃºrin returns just before the prisoners are led away by the Orcs, and in an attempt to prevent this, TÃºrin encounters Glaurung. The dragon, wielding the evil power of Morgoth, enchants and tricks him into returning to Dor-lÃ³min to seek out his mother and sister instead of rescuing Finduilas and other prisoners, which, according to the last words of Gwindor, is the only way to avoid his doom.
When TÃºrin returns to Dor-lÃ³min, he learns that Morwen and Nienor have long been sheltered in Doriath, and that Glaurung deceived him into letting Finduilas go to her death. An enraged TÃºrin incites a fight among the Easterlings who now inhabit Dor-lÃ³min and is compelled to flee once more. He tracks Finduilas's captors to the forest of Brethil , only to learn that she was murdered by the Orcs when the woodmen attempted to rescue the Elvish prisoners. Almost broken by his grief, TÃºrin seeks sanctuary among the Folk of Haleth , who maintain a tenacious resistance against the forces of Morgoth. In Brethil TÃºrin renames himself Turambar, or "Master of Doom" in High-elven , and gradually overrules the gentle, lame Chieftain Brandir .
Meanwhile, in Doriath, Morwen and Nienor hear rumours of TÃºrin's deeds at Nargothrond, and Morwen determines either to find TÃºrin living or hear certain news of his death. Against the council of Thingol she rides out of Doriath alone, and when the king sends a group of Elves to follow and protect her, Nienor conceals herself among the riders and rejoins her mother. Mablung, leading the group, does not wish to proceed with Morwen's mission, but feels compelled to protect her and Nienor. When they approach Nargothrond, Mablung leaves Morwen and Nienor with a group of riders, and takes the rest to explore the ruins of Nargothrond in the hopes of finding information about the fall of the city and of TÃºrin's fate. There they encounter Glaurung, who has established himself in the ruins of Nargothrond, and he scatters Mablung's force before proceeding to the hill on which the women and Elves are waiting. His coming drives all of the horses mad, and in the frenzy Nienor is separated from all the others. When she regains the hilltop alone, she comes face-to face with Glaurung, who, upon discovering her identity, enchants her so that everything she knows is lost, and her mind is made blank.
When Mablung returns to the hill alone, also separated from his company, he finds her waiting on the hill like a lost child, and is forced to attempt the long journey back to Doriath on foot, leading Nienor by the hand. The two of them become stranded in the wilderness, and only the arrival of a few of the other Elves from the scattered group prevents them from starving to death. The few Elves continue their long journey to Doriath, but in an affray with a band of Orcs Nienor runs into the woods and is lost. Eventually she collapses near Brethil on the grave of Finduilas, where TÃºrin finds her and brings her back to the town. There she gradually recovers the use of speech, although she has no memory of any past life. Brandir falls in love with her, but though she feels a sisterly affection for him, she and TÃºrin develop a strong mutual attraction; TÃºrin has never seen her, and she remembers nothing of what she once knew about her brother, and not realizing their kinship, they fall in love. Despite the counsel of Brandir, they soon marry, and Nienor becomes pregnant.
After some time of peace, Glaurung comes to exterminate the Men of Brethil. But Turambar leads a perilous expedition to cut him off, and stabs the dragon from beneath while he is crossing the ravine of Cabed-en-Aras . Meanwhile, Nienor and several other of the people of Brethil leave the safety of the town and, wishing to know what transpired between the men and the dragon, join the scouts waiting for Turambar's return on a hill a short distance from where the dragon was stabbed. As Glaurung is dying on the bank of the ravine, Turambar, who is now alone, pulls his sword from the dragon's belly, and the venomous blood spurts onto his hand and burns him. Overwhelmed with pain and fatigue, he faints. Nienor eventually comes to the place of the battle, followed by Brandir hobbling on his crutch. She takes Turambar's swoon for death and weeps over him, as with a last effort of malice Glaurung opens his eyes, and informs her of the fact that she and her husband are in reality brother and sister, taunting her with her incestuous pregnancy. Glaurung then dies, and his spell of forgetfulness passes from her, and she remembers her entire life. Forced to acknowledge that the dragon's words were true, she throws herself off the nearby cliff into the river Taeglin , and is washed away, as Brandir watches helplessly. When Turambar wakes and returns to the hill where the scouts are waiting, Brandir bitterly informs him of Nienor's death and of hers and Turambar's true relationship as siblings, concerning which he overheard the dragon's words. Believing that Brandir has concocted the story as a lie stemming from jealousy of Nienor's love for TÃºrin, TÃºrin kills Brandir, who declares before dying his hope that he will rejoin Nienor across the sea, which only further infuriates TÃºrin. However, running crazed into the wild, TÃºrin meets Mablung, who has been seeking Nienor for years; as well as Morwen, who was never found after Glaurung's scattering of the Elvish company. Mablung, without knowing anything that has transpired since Nienor was lost in the woods, innocently confirms Brandir's tale. After TÃºrin has learned all the terrible truth from Mablung , he returns to the place where Nienor threw herself from the cliff, and takes his own life upon the sword, Gurthang , which killed Beleg so many years before.
The main part of the narrative ends with the burial of TÃºrin. Appended to this is an extract from The Wanderings of HÃºrin , the next tale of Tolkien's legendarium . This recounts how HÃºrin is at last released by Morgoth and comes to the grave of his children. There he finds Morwen, who has also managed to find the place, but now dies in the arms of her husband with the following sunset.
Publication history
The Children of HÃºrin was published on 17 April 2007, by HarperCollins in the United Kingdom and Canada, and by Houghton Mifflin in the United States. Alan Lee , illustrator of other fantasy works by J. R. R. Tolkien ( The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings ) created the jacket painting, as well as the illustrations within the book. Christopher Tolkien also included an excursus on the evolution of the tale, several genealogical tables, and a redrawn map of Beleriand .
J.R.R. Tolkien wrote that the setting is intended to be our Earth several thousand years ago, [1] although the geographical and historical correspondence with the real world is tenuous. The lands of Middle-earth were populated by Men and other humanoid races: Elves , Dwarves , and Orcs , as well as divine beings, Maiar and Valar . The story concentrates on a Man of the House of Hador , TÃºrin Turambar , and his sister NiÃ«nor NÃ­niel , who are cursed along with their father HÃºrin by the Dark Lord Morgoth . The events take place more than 6,500 years before the War of the Ring .
According to the Tolkien Estate :
The Children of HÃºrin takes the reader back to a time long before The Lord of the Rings, in an area of Middle-earth that was to be drowned before Hobbits appeared, and when the great enemy was still the fallen Vala, Morgoth, and Sauron was only Morgoth's lieutenant. This heroic romance is the tale of the Man, HÃºrin, who dared to defy Morgoth, and his family's tragic destiny, as it follows his son TÃºrin Turambar's travels through the lost world of Beleriand... [2]
Influences
The story is mainly based on the legend of Kullervo , a character from the Finnish folklore poems known as Kalevala . Tolkien drew inspiration from the Kalevala for "The Story of Kullervo" in 1914, which was to become the model for his tale of TÃºrin. [3] TÃºrin also resembles Sigmund , the father of Sigurd in the Volsunga saga , in the incestuous relationship he had with his sister. In Richard Wagner 's opera, Die WalkÃ¼re (also drawn in part from the Volsung myths), Siegmund and Sieglinde are parallels of TÃºrin and Nienor. TÃºrin further resembles Sigurd himself, as both achieve great renown for the slaying of a dragon of immense power and magic.
TÃºrin's resemblance to figures from Classical and Medieval tales can be confirmed by a letter which Tolkien wrote to Milton Waldman , a publisher from HarperCollins , concerning the fate of his works:
There is the Children of HÃºrin, the tragic tale of TÃºrin Turambar and his sister NÃ­niel â€“ of which TÃºrin is the hero: a figure that might be said (by people who like that sort of thing, though it is not very useful) to be derived from elements in Sigurd the Volsung, Oedipus , and the Finnish Kullervo. [4]
The moral issues in The Children of HÃºrin have been compared to Tolkien's analysis of The Battle of Maldon that shows Tolkien's interest in the "theory of courage", [5] and distinguish between arrogance and true courage. TÃºrin's decision to build a bridge at Nargothrond which enables the invasion by Morgoth's forces resembles the character Byrthtnoth from The Battle of Maldon. [6]
Themes and interpretation
The themes explored in the story include evil, free will and predestination. The book reflects also on heroism and courage. It has been suggested that TÃºrin's character is not only shaped by Morgoth's curse but that he himself is also partly responsible for his actions. The curse cannot completely control his free will, and TÃºrin displays traits like arrogance, pride and a desire for honour, that eventually cause the doom of his allies and family. [7]

A brief version of the story formed the base of chapter XXI of The Silmarillion , setting the tale in the context of the wars of Beleriand . Although based on the same texts used to complete the new book, the Silmarillion account leaves out the greater part of the tale.
Other incomplete versions have been published in other works:
The Narn i HÃ®n HÃºrin in Unfinished Tales .
