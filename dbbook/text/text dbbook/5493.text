Plot
The nuclear war between Nazi Germany and the Race ends with a German surrender after Ernst Kaltenbrunner , the FÃ¼hrer , is killed and replaced by Walter Dornberger . Dornberger agrees to disband the Axis Forces , withdraw German troops from occupied France , and disband the German rocket and nuclear forces. The German withdrawal results in instability in the governments of its allies, such as the British Union of Fascists in Britain , as well as clashes between the Free French Forces and the new government of liberated France, and radioactive drift into the Soviet Union . However, Dornberger secretly begins stockpiling weapons and missile parts, allowing Germany the option to rearm itself in the future.
Meanwhile, the nuclear attack on the Race's colony fleet from Second Contact is finally revealed: it was an American attack, ordered by Earl Warren . When it is revealed, Fleetlord Atvar gives Warren a choice: dismantle the American space program, or allow the Race to nuke Indianapolis for revenge. To the surprise of all, Warren allows the Race to destroy Indianapolis, and then commits suicide, with Vice President Harold Stassen taking over. It is eventually stated that the reason Warren allowed the city to be destroyed over the space program was that the Americans were working on a starship that would allow them to journey to the Race's homeworld and repay their visit to Earth.
During this time, the Race itself undergoes large social unrest, due to the effects of ginger on their females. Drug addiction, the black market, and prostitution all arise from it, along with a reproductive system that is unregulated, much like that of humans.
