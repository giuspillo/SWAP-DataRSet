On the morning after Sigmund Freud arrives in New York on his first - and only - visit to the United States in 1909, a stunning dÃ©butante is found bound and strangled in her penthouse apartment, high above Broadway . The following night, another beautiful heiress, Nora Acton, is discovered tied to a chandelier in her parents' home, viciously wounded and unable to speak or to recall her ordeal. Soon Freud and his American disciple, Stratham Younger, are enlisted to help Miss Acton recover her memory, and to piece together the killer's identity. It is a riddle that will test their skills to the limit and lead them on a journey into the darkest places of the city, and of the human mind.
