With their help he explores the planet and is eventually captured by the Dwellers, super-intelligent beings who direct the destinies of the planet.
Critical reception
Boucher and McComas praised the 1949 edition, citing its "sociological criticism, spiritual stimulation and satire of high order." [1] L. Sprague de Camp characterized it as "one of the most remarkable science-fiction stories ever written," saying that "For atmosphere the book is absolutely unsurpassed, and for exciting action it rates high." de Camp, however, also faulted the novel's "long philosophical arguments" in dialogue between its hero and his non-human companion, particularly their "straw-man" elements.
