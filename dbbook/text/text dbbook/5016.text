The Way to Dusty Death is a thriller novel written by Scottish author Alistair MacLean. It was originally published in 1973. The title is a quotation from a famous passage in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Act 5, Scene 5.
Plot introduction
The protagonist , Johnny Harlow, a world champion Formula 1 racing driver, was in a devastating accident during the French Grand Prix , which caused the death of his best friend, a Californian driver and Isaac Jethou, along with maiming his girlfriend. It is only one of a series of crashes which have dogged the Grand Prix circuit in the past season, one of which led to the death of Harlowâ€™s younger brother. The crash appears to have completely destroyed Harlowâ€™s nerve, and the boss of the Coronado team, MacAlpine, for which he drives, is torn between wanting to keep his star driver, and concerns that Harlow has turned into an alcoholic . However, Harlow is playing a role, as he suspects that there is more behind these "accidents" than â€œacts of Godâ€�, and soon finds out that a few people will do anything to prevent him from discovering the truth.
TV adaptation
The Way to Dusty Death appeared as a 1995 made-for-TV movie directed by Geoffrey Reeve , starring Simon MacCorkindale as Harlow, and Linda Hamilton as romantic interest Marie MacAlpine.
