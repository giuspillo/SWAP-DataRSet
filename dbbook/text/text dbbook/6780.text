Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Story is a work of detective fiction which features a flock of anthropomorphic Irish sheep out to solve the murder of their shepherd. Written originally in German by Leonie Swann, the novel has been translated in to more than 30 languages.
Plot
At the beginning of the novel, the sheep belonging to George Glenn awake to find their shepherd dead with a spade in his middle, and resolve to solve his murder. The story is set in the fictional Irish village of Glennkill. Horrified, Miss Maple, the cleverest sheep in the flock (and possibly the world), suggests they find the murderer. The others agree, and Miss Maple volunteers to inspect the body.
A little later, a certain Tom O'Malley finds the body and, panicked, runs to fetch the people of Glennkill. This draws not only the townspeople, but several reporters.
Themes
Largely humorous in character, the novel displays a strong knowledge of sheep behavior, biology, husbandry and breeds (the merino and hebridean are present, among others). [2] [3] Using the perspective of the flock, Swann makes comedic jabs at human character and institutions. [4] [5]
