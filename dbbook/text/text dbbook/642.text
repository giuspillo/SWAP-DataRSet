The Female Man is a feminist science fiction novel written by Joanna Russ. It was originally written in 1970 and first published in 1975. Russ was an avid feminist and challenged sexist views during the 1970s with her novels, short stories, and nonfiction works. These works include We Who Are About To, "When It Changed", and What Are We Fighting For?: Sex, Race, Class, and the Future of Feminism. The novel follows the lives of four women living in parallel worlds that differ in time and place. When they cross over to each other's worlds, their different views on gender roles startle each other's preexisting notions of womanhood. In the end, their encounters influence them to evaluate their lives and shape their ideas of what it means to be a woman.

Explanation of the novel's title
The character Joanna calls herself the â€œfemale manâ€� because she believes that she must forget her identity as a woman in order to be respected (p. 5). She states that â€œthere is one and only one way to possess that in which we are defectiveâ€¦Become itâ€� (p. 139). Her metaphorical transformation refers to her decision to seek equality by rejecting womenâ€™s dependence on men.
The Female Man includes several fictional worlds.
Joanna's World: Joanna exists in a world that's similar to Earth in the 1970s.
Jeannine's World: Jeannine lives in a world where the Great Depression never ended. The Second World War never happened because Adolf Hitler was assassinated in 1936, and Chiang Kai-Shek controls Hong Kong, as Japanese imperialism still dominates the Chinese mainland.
Whileaway (Janet's World): Whileaway is a utopian society in the far future where all the men died from a gender-specific plague over 800 years ago. After mastering parthenogenesis , women form lesbian relationships and parent children within them. Although the world is technologically advanced, their societies are mostly agrarian. Their technology enables them to genetically merge ova in order to procreate. Joanna Russ's Nebula Award winning short story When It Changed (1972) also takes place on Whileaway, but earlier. [1]
Jael's World: Jael's world is a dystopia where men and women are literally engaged in a "battle of the sexes". Although they have been in conflict for over 40 years, the two societies still participate in trade with each other. Women trade children in exchange for resources. In order for men to cope with their sexual desires, young boys undergo cosmetic surgery that physically changes their appearance so that they look like women. Jael is heterosexual and has sex with Davey, a lobotomised adolescent male, at her home.
Plot summary
The novel begins when Janet Evason suddenly arrives in Jeannine Dadierâ€™s world. Janet is from Whileaway, a futuristic world where a plague killed all of the men over 800 years ago, and Jeannine lives in a world that never experienced the end of the Great Depression . Janet finds Jeannine at a Chinese New Year festival and takes her to Joannaâ€™s world. Joanna comes from a world that is beginning its feminist movement .
Acting as a guide, Joanna takes Janet to a party in her world to show her how women and men interact with each other. Janet quickly finds herself the object of a manâ€™s attention, and after he harasses her, Janet knocks the man down and mocks him. Because Joannaâ€™s world believes that women are inferior to men, everyone is shocked. Janet expresses her desire to experience living with a typical family so Joanna takes Janet to the Wildingsâ€™ household. Janet meets their daughter Laura Rose who instantly admires Janetâ€™s confidence and independence as a woman. Laura realizes that she is attracted to Janet and begins to pursue a sexual relationship with her. This is transgressive for both of them, as Whileaway's taboo against cross-generational relationships (having a relationship with someone old enough to be your parent or child) is as strong as the taboo against same-sex relationships on Laura's world.
The novel then follows Jeannine and Joanna as they accompany Janet back to Whileaway. They meet Vittoria, Janetâ€™s wife, and stay at their home. Joanna finds herself under scrutiny when Vittoria uses a story about a bear trapped between two worlds as a metaphor for her life. Jeannine returns to her world with Joanna, and they both go to vacation at her brotherâ€™s house. Jeannineâ€™s mother pesters her about her love life and whether she is going to get married soon. Jeannine goes on a few dates with some men but still finds herself dissatisfied. Jeannine begins to doubt her sense of reality, but soon decides that she wants to assimilate into her role as a woman. She calls Cal and agrees to marry him.
Joanna, Jeannine, Janet, and Laura are lounging in Laura's house. Laura tries to glorify Janetâ€™s status in Whileaway, but Janet explains that her world does not value her particularly, but chose her as inter-dimensional explorer because she was more expendable than others ("I am stupid," she explains). At 3 a.m., Joanna comes down, unable to sleep, and finds Jeannine and Janet awake as well. Suddenly they are no longer at Lauraâ€™s house but in another world.
Joanna, Jeannine, and Janet have arrived in Jaelâ€™s world which is experiencing a 40-year old war between male and female societies. Jael explains that she works for the Bureau of Comparative Ethnology , an organization that concentrates on peopleâ€™s various counterparts in different parallel worlds. She reveals that she is the one who brought all of them together because they are essentially â€œfour versions of the same womanâ€� (p. 162). Jael takes all of them with her into enemy territory because she appears to be negotiating a deal with one of the male leaders. At first, the male leader appears to be promoting equality, but Jael quickly realizes that he still believes in the inferiority of women. Jael reveals herself as a ruthless assassin, kills the man, and shuttles all of the women back to her house. Jael finally tells the other women why she has assembled all of them. She wants to create bases in the other womenâ€™s worlds without the male society knowing and eventually empower women to overthrow oppressive men and their gender roles for women.
In the end, Jeannine and Joanna agree to help Jael and assimilate the women soldiers into their worlds, but Janet refuses, given the overall pacifism of Whileaway. Jeannine and Joanna appear to have become stronger individuals and are excited to rise up against their gender roles. Janet is not moved by Jaelâ€™s intentions so Jael tells Janet that the reason for the absence of men on Whileaway is not because of a plague but because the women won the war and killed all of the men in its timeline's past. Janet refuses to believe Jael, and the other women are annoyed at Janetâ€™s resistance. The novel ends with the women separating and returning to their worlds, each with a new perspective on her life, her world, and her identity as a woman.
Major characters
Jeannine Dadier is a librarian who lives in a world that never escaped the Great Depression . She believes that â€œthere is a barrier between [her] and real life which can be removed only by a man or marriageâ€� (p. 120). She doubts her boyfriend Calâ€™s ability to make her happy, yet eventually she succumbs and becomes engaged to him. At the end of the novel, Jeannine appears to have broken from the expectations of marriage and welcomes the social revolution against men.
Joanna, living in the 1970s, comes from a world remarkably similar to Earth. The feminist movement has just begun, and Joanna is determined to refute her worldâ€™s belief that women are inferior to men. Joanna is witty and smart; however, she struggles to assert her abilities and intelligence among her male peers. She repeatedly refers to herself as the â€œfemale manâ€� (p. 5) to indicate her adoption of the male gender role and separate herself from being identified as just another woman.
Janet Evason Belin comes from a futuristic world called Whileaway where all the men died of a gender specific plague over 800 years ago. She is a Safety and Peace officer, similar to a police officer, and has just become an emissary to other worlds. She is married with Vittoria and has two children. In addition to being confident and assertive, Janet is perhaps the most independent from men because she has never experienced patriarchal domination.
Alice Jael Reasoner, often referred to as Jael, is an assassin living in a world where a 40-year old war has caused men and women to separate into warring societies. She is a radical and does not appeal much to her emotion but, focuses solely on facts as they are presented to her. Jael is the instigator behind the four womenâ€™s meeting and appears to be proposing a revolution against all men.
Minor characters
Laura Rose is the daughter in the family that Janet stays with when she is visiting Joannaâ€™s world. She proclaims herself to be a â€œvictim of penis envy ,â€� frustrated that she must stifle her potential in order to become a housewife (p. 65). Janetâ€™s confidence and independence from men fascinates Laura, and Laura begins to pursue a sexual relationship with her. Laura is the only character other than the four major ones to have the narrative told through her perspective.
Cal is Jeannineâ€™s boyfriend and soon-to-be fiancÃ©. Jeannine does not believe that Cal is masculine enough to provide for her.
Mrs. Dadier is Jeannineâ€™s mother who lives with Jeannineâ€™s brother and his family. When Jeannine spends a vacation at her brotherâ€™s house, Mrs. Dadier plagues Jeannine with lectures regarding the importance of marriage.
Major themes and symbols
Gender roles
Written during the 1970s, when the feminist movement was at its height, The Female Man studies how women struggle to retain their identity as women yet still assert themselves as equals to men. The novelâ€™s main theme of gender roles occurs in each of the four charactersâ€™ worlds. Because of the different environments in which they were raised, each woman has a different idea on what it means to be a woman. Jeannine believes that only marriage can validate her existence while Janet, because of the absence of men in her world, does not understand how women can be inferior to men. Joanna searches to establish her identity as a strong individual and believes that she must adopt masculine characteristics in order to be viewed as an equal. Because Jael is in war with men, she believes that men are expendable and should be eliminated. The novel investigates each of the womenâ€™s views and questions how far women should go to break gender roles.
Sexuality
Sexuality becomes a recurring theme throughout the novel, primarily explored through Janet's experiences. Janet believes in an active sexual life, and she serves to show the fulfillment same-sex relations offer.
Nature vs. nurture
The differences between each of the womenâ€™s personalities suggest that the environment/civilization from which they come shape their beliefs and actions. Jael says, â€œGiven a reasonable variation, we are the same racial typeâ€¦what you see is essentially the same genotype, modified by age, by circumstances, by education, by diet, by learning, by God knows whatâ€�(161). Through Jaelâ€™s revelation that they are in fact each otherâ€™s counterparts, the text shows that though the women have the same genetics , the radical differences between the womenâ€™s views must be a result of their varying environments. The text sheds light on the importance of environment because the feminist movement sought to reconstruct societyâ€™s preexisting ideas of womenâ€™s roles.
The moon
The moon is a recurring symbol that appears when the narrative focuses on Jeannine and Joannaâ€™s perspectives. Jeannineâ€™s first sentence is â€œSee the moon,â€� and when Jeannine runs away from her family, Joanna finds her â€œlooking at the moonâ€� (111,113). Joanna realizes that all of the significant figures in any field are always male, and she laments that she was â€œnever on the moonâ€� (135). The moon may be a reference to the Greek goddess Artemis , the ultimate independent woman warrior. Jeannineâ€™s obsession with the moon is her unconscious desire to be free from societyâ€™s limitations on women. Joannaâ€™s statement can be interpreted as her inability to ever achieve true independence since she must reject her femininity in order to be regarded as an equal to men. The moon is relevant only to Jeannine and Joanna because they live in worlds where women are considered subordinate to men. Janet recalls that her first sentence was also "see the moon" which provides support for the interpretation that the four J's are essentially the same person.
Technology
The symbol of technology is represented most prominently in Janet's all-female utopian future of Whileaway. The text implies that the futuristic technology of Whileaway is how the women of Whileaway can become the strongest, most advanced, best-equipped version of themselves to ensure ease in carrying out vocational and professional tasks. Technology on Whileaway is the factor that ensured an increased overall intelligence through genetic engineering. Technology is approached as something that is essential to Whileaway culture and its ability to grow and thrive. The women do not show either a strong appreciation for or disregard of their world's technology. They treat it, rather, as something that is just present and does not need explanation or background. Technology is used in Jael's dystopian, sex-warring world in much the same regard; simply as an integral, ever-present entity.
"Representations of technology provide [Russ] a way of talking about temporality and change, about historicity and futurity, including agential social change" (p. 406). [2]
Structure and format
The novel is divided into nine parts, with each further divided into chapters. The sections of the novel are usually dedicated to one characterâ€™s perspective, but often the point-of-view changes between the four characters and skips from location and time. For example, part five begins in Jeannineâ€™s world yet the narrative is through Joannaâ€™s perspective. The novel never clearly indicates who is speaking and, as a result, often creates confusion in the narration. The novel does provide clues, however, so that the reader can infer the identity of the narrator.
Joanna, Janet, and Jaelâ€™s perspectives are expressed through the first person narrative , but they often refer to themselves in the third person while the narration is still through their point of view. Jeannineâ€™s perspective is initially told solely through a third person narrative . Jeannine does eventually adopt a first person narrative, indicating her emerging doubt of her dependence on a man and her fate as a dutiful wife. Joanna recognizes that her own style of narration reflects a feminine quality. Joanna says, â€œI have no structureâ€¦my thoughts seep out shapelessly like menstrual fluid, it is all very female and deep and full of essences, it is very primitive and full of â€˜andâ€™s,â€™ it is called â€˜run-on sentencesâ€™â€� (p. 137). Joanna also inserts common conversations in the form of a script that demonstrate her frustration with menâ€™s ignorance of women. Janet often gives background history on Whileaway to provide insight on the nature of her world. Jael is slightly introduced in part two, signaled by an italicized text; however, her story begins in part eight with a repetition of the italicized chapter. The novel mostly focuses on Jaelâ€™s perspective until the end of the novel except for a few moments when the narrative is told through the other threeâ€™s point-of-view.
Literary significance and reception
As the feminist movement began to gain attention, however, many regarded the novel as one of the most influential works in feminist literature [3] and its wide acceptance heralded the start of feminist science fiction . [1]
â€œA work of frightening power, but it is also a work of great fictional subtletyâ€¦it should appeal to all intelligent people who look for exciting ideation, crackling dialogue, provocative fictional games-playing in their reading.â€� â€“ Douglas Barbour, Toronto Star
â€œA stunning book, a work to be read with great respect. Itâ€™s also screamingly funny.â€�- Elizabeth Lynn , San Francisco Review of books
"In sum, it is a superior SF novel, though perhaps too demanding in an emotional sense ever to be popular even with those expressing the currently fashionable opinions on women's liberation."â€”R.D. Mullen
