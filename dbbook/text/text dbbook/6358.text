And the Ass Saw the Angel is the first novel by the musician and singer Nick Cave, originally published in 1989 by Black Spring Press in the United Kingdom and Harper Collins in the United States. It was re-published in 2003 by 2.13.61. A luxury "collector's edition" was released, in the summer of 2007, by Black Spring Press. With its Southern Gothic setting, critics have compared it favorably with novels by American authors William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor. Cave's second novel, The Death of Bunny Munro, was published in September, 2009.
Plot
And the Ass Saw the Angel tells the story of Euchrid Eucrow, a mute born to an abusive drunken mother and a father obsessed with cruel traps and animal torture. His father's dangerous traps could maim or kill an unwary person. An outcast, scorned even among outsiders, in a valley of fanatically religious Ukulites, Euchrid bears his mother's beatings, his father's inturned indifference, and the hatred and loathing of an entire town. Euchrid's increasingly fractured mind teems with words and horrible angelic visions, narrated by his silent Southern drawl. (To wit, Cave phonetically renders the boy-narrator's "I" as "Ah.") Raised to inevitable madness in this world of inbreeding, moonshine , and fanaticism, Euchrid will exact his terrible vengeance on the people who have made his life one of nearly unrelenting pain.
Major themes
The lyrics of some of the songs from the first few albums of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds ( From Her to Eternity , The Firstborn Is Dead and Your Funeral... My Trial ), are extensions of the ideas represented in the novel. The title comes from the Bible , the Book of Numbers 22:23, where Balaam does not see the angel of the Lord but his donkey does. The Bible is heavily referenced throughout the novel. In an interview with BOMB magazine, Cave noted, â€œThere are a number of voices in the book: first person narrative by Euchrod, third person authorial voice, quotations usually from the Bible, either real or ersatz, constant changes in tone or approach to language, depending on who is talking. When I first started the book there were certain elements I wasnâ€™t interested in writing about. When you read a novel, you have to wade through the setting up of the scene before the story starts. So I wrote a long prologue. It has no action. It includes documentary, poetry, maps and charts, in very short chapters. Once this is done, the actual story begins. The voice then changes between the narratorâ€™s truth and Euchrodâ€™s delusionary truth. The final book is Euchrodâ€™s monologue which runs to the climaxâ€� [4]
One particularly present theme is Man's inhumanity to man and their innate ability to fear what they do not understand. Euchrid is constantly under siege from those who perceive difference as a threat. The only other character to see Euchrid as something more than a dumb beast is Beth (and to a certain extent, her mother). Though Beth is taken into the fold by the Ukulites, she too is different from the rest. There is a strange transference of thought throughout the novel; her difference is seen by the community as godly, while Beth sees Euchrid as godly. Another theme presented in the novel is the beauty of things perceived as ugly. In an interview with director Lindzee Smith, Cave revealed, â€œThe things that are ugly are supposed to be ugly. Iâ€™d hate to think the book was only about ugly things. Itâ€™s about innocence as well â€“â€“the beauty in that. Thereâ€™s a cartoon image to many of the charactersâ€“â€“Beth, who I see as the idealized young girl, perfect and innocent, seen through the obsessive eyes of Euchrid.â€� [4]
