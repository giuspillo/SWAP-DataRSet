Emile, or On Education or Émile, Or Treatise on Education (French: Émile, ou De l’éducation) is a treatise on the nature of education and on the nature of man written by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who considered it to be the “best and most important of all my writings”. Due to a section of the book entitled “Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar,” Emile was banned in Paris and Geneva and was publicly burned in 1762, the year of its first publication. During the French Revolution, Emile served as the inspiration for what became a new national system of education.

Politics and philosophy
The work tackles fundamental political and philosophical questions about the relationship between the individual and society â€” how, in particular, the individual might retain what Rousseau saw as innate human goodness while remaining part of a corrupting collectivity. Its opening sentence: â€œEverything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man.â€�
Rousseau seeks to describe a system of education that would enable the natural man he identifies in The Social Contract (1762) to survive corrupt society. [4] He employs the novelistic device of Emile and his tutor to illustrate how such an ideal citizen might be educated. Emile is scarcely a detailed parenting guide but it does contain some specific advice on raising children . [5] It is regarded by some as the first philosophy of education in Western culture to have a serious claim to completeness, as well as being one of the first Bildungsroman novels, having preceded Goethe's Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship by more than thirty years. [6]
Book divisions
The text is divided into five books: the first three are dedicated to the child Emile, the fourth to an exploration of the adolescent , and the fifth to outlining the education of his female counterpart Sophie, as well as to Emileâ€™s domestic and civic life.
Rousseau
In Book I, Rousseau discusses not only his fundamental philosophy but also begins to outline how one would have to raise a child to conform with that philosophy. He begins with the early physical and emotional development of the infant and the child.
Emile attempts to â€œfind a way of resolving the contradictions between the natural man who is â€˜all for himselfâ€™ and the implications of life in society.â€� [7] The famous opening line does not bode well for the educational projectâ€”â€œEverything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man.â€� [8] But Rousseau acknowledges that every society â€œmust choose between making a man or a citizenâ€� [9] and that the best â€œsocial institutions are those that best know how to denature man, to take his absolute existence from him in order to give him a relative one and transport the I into the common unity.â€� [10] To â€œdenature manâ€� for Rousseau is to suppress some of the â€œnaturalâ€� instincts that he extols in The Social Contract , published the same year as Emile, but while it might seem that for Rousseau such a process would be entirely negative, this is not so. Emile is not a panegyric for the loss of the noble savage, a term Rousseau never actually used. Instead, it is an effort to explain how natural man can live within society.
Many of Rousseau's suggestions in this book are restatements of the ideas of other educational reformers. For example, he endorses Locke's program of â€œharden[ing childrenâ€™s] bodies against the intemperance of season, climates, elements; against hunger, thirst, fatigueâ€� [11] He also emphasizes the perils of swaddling and the benefits of mothers nursing their own infants. Rousseauâ€™s enthusiasm for breastfeeding led to him to argue â€œbut let mothers deign to nurse their children, morals will reform themselves, natureâ€™s sentiments will be awakened in every heart, the state will be repeopled," [12] a hyperbole that demonstrates Rousseauâ€™s commitment to grandiose rhetoric. As Peter Jimack, the noted Rousseau scholar, argues â€œRousseau consciously sought to find the striking, lapidary phrase which would compel the attention of his readers and move their hearts, even when it meant, as it often did, an exaggeration of his thought.â€� And, in fact, Rousseauâ€™s pronouncements, although not original, effected a revolution in swaddling and breast-feeding. [13]
Book II
The second book concerns the initial interactions of the child with the world. Rousseau believed that at this phase education should be derived less from books and more from their interactions with the world, with an emphasis on developing the senses, and the ability to draw inferences from them. Rousseau concludes the chapter with an example of a boy who has been successfully educated through this phase. The father takes the boy out flying kites, and asks the child to infer the position of the kite by looking only at the shadow. This is a task that the child has never specifically been taught, but through inference and understanding of the physical world, the child is able to succeed in his task. In some ways, this approach is the precursor of the Montessori method .
Book III
The third book concerns the selection of a trade . Rousseau believed it necessary that the child must be taught a manual skill appropriate to his gender and age, and suitable to his inclinations, by worthy role models. [14]
Book IV
Frontispiece to Rousseau's Ã‰mile by de Launay for the 1782 edition. The original caption read: "L'Ã©ducation de l'homme commence Ã  sa naissance" ("A man's education begins at birth"). [15]
Once Emile is physically strong and learns to carefully observe the world around him, he is ready for the last part of his educationâ€”sentiment: â€œWe have made an active and thinking being. It remains for us, in order to complete the man, only to make a loving and feeling beingâ€”that is to say, to perfect reason by sentimentâ€� [16] Emile is a teenager at this point and it is only now that Rousseau believes he is capable of understanding complex human emotions, particularly sympathy. Rousseau argues that the child cannot put himself in the place of others but once adolescence has been reached and he is able do so, Emile can finally be brought into the world and socialized. [17]
In addition to introducing a newly passionate Emile to society during his adolescent years, the tutor also introduces him to religion. According to Rousseau, children cannot understand abstract concepts such as the soul before the age of about fifteen or sixteen, so to introduce religion to them is dangerous. He writes, â€œit is a lesser evil to be unaware of the divinity than to offend itâ€� [18] Moreover, because children are incapable of understanding the difficult concepts that are part of religion, he points out that children will only recite what is told to them â€“ they are unable to believe. Book IV also contains the infamous â€œProfession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar,â€� the section that was largely responsible for the condemnation of Emile and the one, paradoxically, most frequently excerpted and published independently of its parent tome. Rousseau claims at the end of the â€œProfessionâ€� that it is not â€œa rule for the sentiments that one ought to follow in religious matters, but... an example of the way one can reason with oneâ€™s pupil in order not to diverge from the method I have tried to establish." [19] Such a claim was clearly difficult for many readers at the time to accept and still is. Rousseau, through the priest, leads his readers through an argument with only one concluding belief: â€œ natural religion .â€� Even more importantly, after this brief excursion into religious education, religion does not play any role in Emileâ€™s life; religion, however important to Rousseau (Rousseau is believed to have created the Savoyard Vicar by combining the traits of two Savoyard priests whom he had known in his childhood: AbbÃ© Gaime from Turin and AbbÃ© GÃ¢tier from Annecy), is insignificant in Emileâ€™s education and socialization.

Book V
In Book V, Rousseau turns to the education of Sophie, Emileâ€™s wife-to-be. This brief description of female education sparked an immense contemporary response, perhaps even more so than Emile itself. Mary Wollstonecraft , for example, dedicated a substantial portion of her chapter â€œAnimadversions on Some of the Writers who have Rendered Women Objects of Pity, Bordering on Contemptâ€� in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) to attacking Rousseau and his arguments. Rousseau begins his description of Sophie, the ideal woman, by describing the differences between men and women in a famous passage:
In what they have in common, they are equal. Where they differ, they are not comparable. A perfect woman and a perfect man ought not to resemble each other in mind any more than in looks, and perfection is not susceptible of more or less. In the union of the sexes each contributes equally to the common aim, but not in the same way. From this diversity arises the first assignable difference in the moral relations of the two sexes.
While the opening â€œin what they have in common, they are equalâ€� offers an intriguing possibility for women, Rousseau does not elaborate on it. For him, sexual differences far outweigh similarities and those differences tilt in manâ€™s favor: women should be â€œpassive and weak,â€� â€œput up little resistanceâ€� and are â€œmade specially to please man.â€� [20]
Rousseau also touches on the political upbringing of Emile in book V by including a concise version of his The Social Contract in the book. His political treatise The Social Contract was published in the same year as Emile and was likewise soon banned by the government for its controversial theories on general will . The version of this work in Emile, however, does not go into detail concerning the tension between the Sovereign and the Executive, but instead refer the reader to the original work. [21]
Ã‰mile et Sophie
In the incomplete sequel to Emile, Ã‰mile et Sophie (English: Emilius and Sophia), published after Rousseauâ€™s death, Sophie is unfaithful (in what is hinted at might be a drugged rape), and Emile, initially furious with her betrayal, remarks â€œthe adulteries of the women of the world are not more than gallantries; but Sophia an adulteress is the most odious of all monsters; the distance between what she was, and what she is, is immense. No! there is no disgrace, no crime equal to hers.â€� [22] He later relents somewhat, blaming himself for taking her to a city full of temptation, but he still abandons her and their children. Throughout the agonized internal monologue, represented through letters to his old tutor, he repeatedly comments on all of the affective ties that he has formed in his domestic lifeâ€”â€œthe chains [his heart] forged for itselfâ€� [23] As he begins to recover from the shock, the reader is led to believe that these â€œchainsâ€� are not worth the price of possible painâ€”â€œBy renouncing my attachments to a single spot, I extended them to the whole earth, and, while I ceased to be a citizen, became truly a man.â€� [24] While in La Nouvelle HÃ©loÃ¯se, the ideal is domestic, rural happiness (if not bliss), in Emile and its sequel, the ideal is â€œemotional self-sufficiency which was the natural state of primitive, pre-social man, but which for modern man can be attained only by the suppression of his natural inclinations.â€� [25]
