The Periodic Table (Italian: Il Sistema Periodico) is a collection of short stories by Primo Levi, published in 1975, named after the periodic table in chemistry. In 2006, the Royal Institution of Great Britain named it the best science book ever.
^ The Guardian: Levi's memoir beats Darwin to win science book title.
^ In the chapter, Nickel, "...on some other of those long nights were born two stories of islands and freedom, the first I felt inclined to write after...liceo..." (1984 pb edition, p. 73), and "Nor have the two mineral tales which I wrote then disappeared... The reader will find them here in the succeeding pages, inserted, like a prisoner's dream of escape, between these tales of militant chemistry." (ibid., p. 78)
^ "One story fantasize[s] about a remote precursor of mine, a hunter of lead instead of nickel..." ibid., p. 73
^ "...the other [story], ambiguous and mercurial, I had taken from a reference to the island of Tristan da Cunha that I happened to see during that period." ibid., p. 73
