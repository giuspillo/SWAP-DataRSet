English as She Is Spoke is the common name of a 19th-century book written by Pedro Carolino and falsely additionally credited to José da Fonseca, which was intended as a Portuguese-English conversational guide or phrase book, but is regarded as a classic source of unintentional humour, as the given English translations are generally completely incoherent. Carolino added Fonseca's name to the book without the latter knowing about it. Fonseca had written a successful Portuguese-French phrase book, which Carolino adapted. The humour appears to be a result of dictionary-aided literal translation, which causes many idiomatic expressions to be translated wildly inappropriately. For example, the Portuguese phrase chover a cântaros is translated as raining in jars, whereas an idiomatic English translation would be raining buckets. It is widely believed that Carolino could not speak English, and that a French-English dictionary was used to translate an earlier Portuguese-French phrase book O Novo guia da conversação em francês e português, written by José da Fonseca. Carolino added Fonseca's name to the book in an attempt to give it some credibility. The Portuguese-French phrase book is apparently a competent work, without the defects that characterise English as She Is Spoke. In 2002, Alexander MacBride of the UCLA Department of Linguistics suggested that it is likely that the Portuguese-English book was an unauthorised translation by Pedro Carolino of the Portuguese-French book, without the involvement of José da Fonseca, rather than a joint effort by the two.

Cultural appraisals and influence
Mark Twain said of English as She Is Spoke that "Nobody can add to the absurdity of this book, nobody can imitate it successfully, nobody can hope to produce its fellow; it is perfect." [4]
The book played its part in maintaining morale during the American Civil Warâ€” Frederick W. Seward recording how, in January 1864, "As John Hay read aloud its queer inverted sentences, Lincoln and Seward laughed heartily, their minds finding a brief but welcome relief from care". [5]
Stephen Pile mentions this work in The Book of Heroic Failures , and comments: "Is there anything in conventional English which could equal the vividness of 'to craunch a marmoset '?" [6] [7] The original has "to craunch the marmoset", an entry under the book's "Idiotisms and Proverbs." This is the author's attempt to translate the French slang idiomatic expression "croquer le marmot", used to indicate waiting patiently for someone to open a door, [8] with "croquer" referring to the knocking or rapping sound and " marmot " a term for the grotesque door knockers in vogue at the time. The term is presumably inspired by the marmot's large teeth, as many of the grotesque door knockers were figures holding the knocker clasped in their teeth.
Tristan Bernard wrote a very short comedy with a similar name : L'Anglais tel qu'on le parle. Ionesco 's La Cantatrice chauve is mostly made of language conversation book lines used out of context .
