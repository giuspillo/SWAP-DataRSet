Explanation of the novel's title
The title is derived from an old children's game, whereby one will ask: "Adam and Eve and Pinch-Me went down to the river to play; Adam and Eve were drowned, so who do you think was saved?" When the other participant replies "Pinch-Me", the questioner proceeds to do so!
