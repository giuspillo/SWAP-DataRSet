The Prince and the Pilgrim is a 1995 fantasy novel by Mary Stewart. Preceded by The Wicked Day, it is the fifth installment in a number of novels of hers covering the Arthurian legend.
Plot introduction
The Prince, the protagonist, is named Alexander. His father, Prince Baudouin, is murdered by the King of Cornwall, King March. When Alexander comes of age, he sets out to Camelot to seek justice from King Arthur and to avenge the death of his father. The pilgrim is named Alice. Alice rescues a young French nobleman who has in his possession an enchanted silver cup. Many believe the chalice to be the mysterious and much-sought-after Holy Grail .
Plot summary
Prince Alexander is diverted in his quest for justice by the enchantments of Morgan LeFay, the seductive but evil sorceress. She persuades him to attempt a theft of the Holy Grail so that she can own it and thus gain power over King Arthur and his court. Alexander's search for the mysterious cup leads him to Alice. Together the prince and the pilgrim find what they've really been seeking: love.
The tale is a self-contained novel taking place during Arthur's reign (possibly during the events in The Last Enchantment ), and does not serve as a follow-up to The Wicked Day .
