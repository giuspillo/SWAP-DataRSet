The Canon: A Whirligig Tour of the Beautiful Basics of Science is a book written by American science author Natalie Angier.
Overview
The Canon presents a summary of some of the different areas of science, as well as extensive descriptions of, and interviews with, contemporary scientists who work in these fields. Angierâ€™s tenet is that an understanding of the basics of major areas of science can assist with providing a means by which to understand current scientific issues, and that this process should be fun. In her Introduction, Angier writes:
â€œ
Of course you should know about science, for the same reason Dr. Seuss counsels his readers to sing with a Ying or play Ring the Gack: These things are fun, and fun is good.
â€�
In The Canon, Angier weaves the words provided to her by the scientists she interviewed throughout her descriptions of such things as how atoms work, why there are chemical reactions and how they occur, how the cells in our bodies and the DNA contained within those cells are structured and function, how the planet Earth is constructed, and what we currently know about the vastness of the universe. Through the lens of these various scientists, we can start to know more about how scientists experience their work, how they think about it, and why they do what they do.
