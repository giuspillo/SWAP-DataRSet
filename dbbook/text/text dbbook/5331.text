Garner's Modern American Usage, edited by Bryan Garner, is a usage guide for contemporary American English. Modern American Usage covers issues of usage, pronunciation, and style, from plurals and literary techniques to distinctions between similar words and the usage of foreign terms.
Editions
The first edition was published in 1998 as "A Dictionary of Modern American Usage." In 2003 the second edition was published under the current title with a third more content than its predecessor. [1] A third edition was published in August 2009. Oxford University Press has also published an abridged, paperback edition of Modern American Usage as the Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style (2000).
Reception
Novelist David Foster Wallace said, "The fact of the matter is that Garner's dictionary is extremely good ... Its format ... includes entries on individual words and phrases and expostulative small-cap MINI-ESSAYS." [2] (An unabridged, much lengthier version of David Wallace's essay, "Authority and American Usage", appeared in a 2006 anthology of essays entitled Consider the Lobster .) Garrison Keillor has called Garner's Modern American Usage one of the five most influential books in his library. Other critics, from John Simon to William Safire to Bill Walsh to Barbara Wallraff , have praised the book's clear, simple, and nuanced guidance.
Michael Quinion of WorldWideWords.org said in his review [1] that usage guides â€œrow a course against the current of modern lexicography and linguistics,â€� which are descriptive fields that often fail to "meet the day-to-day needs of those users of English who want to speak and write in a way that is acceptable to educated opinion.â€� Quinion opined that Garner lays down rules without falling victim to â€œworn-out shibboleths or language superstitions.â€�
