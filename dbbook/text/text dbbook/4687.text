The plot is set in the Forbidden Kingdom, a remote Himalayan country. A Buddhist lama named Tensing takes his disciple, Prince Dil Bahadur, to the Valley of the Yeti to find healing plants that grow nowhere else. They are ringed with armed yetis just as they drink in the sights, but the matriarch saves them and says the fast-dwindling yetis have lost their forebearsâ€™ human-like complexity.
The lamas help them milk goats to feed the cubs, and it turns out the local fountains are toxic. The beasts improve once they shun the founts, and to thank the strangers they show them the plants they want.
Meanwhile Alex Cold leaves Brazil for New York along with his grandmother Kate, an International Geographic reporter. He gives her the diamond eggs Nadia found near the Amazon, and tells her to raise money for the People of the Mistâ€”who he met in the prequelâ€”and other Indios. Kate suspects the eggsâ€™ value and asks a jeweler who confirms their unparalleled worth; never has he seen like-sized gems. Six months later, the Diamond Foundation has been formed with the help of anthropologist Ludovic Leblanc, who is Kateâ€™s nemesis. Now tasked with writing about the Forbidden Kingdom, she takes Nadia and Alex with her despite her employerâ€™s misgivings.
The worldâ€™s second-richest man pays a crime lord known as the Specialist to steal the kingdomâ€™s gold dragon. He wants its gifts of prophecy to predict stock and make him the worldâ€™s richest person.
Soon after landing in Asia, Kate and her friends are trapped in a plot to kidnap indigenous girls. When Nadia, who is thought to be native, is captured along with Pema, Alex and Kate enlist the prince, his teacher, the kingdomâ€™s forces, and the yetis to find them.
