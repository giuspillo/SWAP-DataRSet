Origins and publishing history
At some point during the drafting of his Ph.D. , the character that would later become Blake simply appeared to Skelton, trapped in a library and begging for help. Over the next three years, Skelton worked to finish his Doctoral Thesis. Upon its completion, he moved to Mainz, the setting for the first half of one of his story lines, [1] and began writing the novel. Originally, the book was only Blake's story, and did not include the second story line about Gutenberg [1] and his apprentice, Endymion Spring. Matthew Skelton was pushed to complete the second half of the story by a friend who had reportedly asked him who Endymion Spring was. Endymion Spring was released in the United Kingdom in March 2006, and was published in the United States later in the same year, ahead of schedule.
Warner Bros. currently hold rights to an Endymion Spring film.
Plot summary
Endymion Spring has a double storyline. The first story follows two children in current day Oxford , Blake and Duck Winters. Blake is twelve years old and his sister is a few years younger. The two happen to come across a strange book in a library in Oxford, which is entitled Endymion Spring. After finding out that it leads to a book of all the knowledge in the world, all the knowledge Adam and Eve tried to obtain from eating of that forbidden tree of knowledge but lost, they then embark on a quest to find it. However, when they do, the story then becomes a battle against the Person in Shadow, a person whose heart has turned black with evil and desire for the knowledge and power of the book. The second story line follows the journey of a young printerâ€™s devil who works in Gutenberg â€™s workshop named Endymion Spring from his hometown in Mainz , Germany to Oxford, which was then a settlement of monks. The two story lines are about 600 years apart, with Spring's story taking place at the epoch of the printing press in 1453, and Blake's taking place in the late 20th or early 21st century.
