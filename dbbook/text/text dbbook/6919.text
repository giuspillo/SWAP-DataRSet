Reviews and commentary
Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime â€” In the first, Wolfe and Archie are in fine form, and murder at a flower show provides a suitable background for Wolfe's talents and predatory instincts. Archie himself innocently pulls the trigger. The second story is less satisfactory, involving as it does a highly debatable move by the murderer to disarm suspicion. Besides, too many animals. [1]
Time , "Murder in May" (June 1, 1942) â€” Nero Wolfe and his ebullient amanuensis Archie Goodwin are here at top form in two "novellas" â€” "Black Orchids" and "Cordially Invited to Meet Death." The first concerns a cleverly contrived murder at New York's annual Flower Show. The second features an adroit bit of poisoning in the fantastic Riverdale mÃ©nage â€” and menagerie â€” of a successful party-arranger for Manhattan society. First-class entertainment. [2]
