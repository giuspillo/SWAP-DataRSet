Plot
The author's note is an integral part of the novel. Unusually, the note describes entirely fictional events. It serves to establish and enforce one of the novel's main themes: the relativity of truth.
Life of Pi is divided into four sections. In the first section the main character Pi Patel, an adult Canadian , reminisces about his childhood in India . His father owns a zoo in Pondicherry . The livelihood provides the family with a relatively affluent lifestyle and some understanding of animal psychology . Pi describes how he acquired his full name, Piscine Molitor Patel, as a tribute to the swimming pool in France . After hearing schoolmates tease him by transforming the first name into "Pissing", he establishes the short form of his name as " Pi " when he starts secondary school. The name, he says, pays tribute to the irrational number which is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. In describing his experiences Pi describes several other unusual situations involving proper names. Two visitors to the zoo, one a devout Muslim and one a committed atheist, bear identical names. A memorably ferocious tiger at the zoo bears the name Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error in which human and animal names were reversed. [9]
Pi is raised a Hindu who practices vegetarianism . As a fourteen-year-old he investigates Christianity and Islam and decides to become an adherent of all three religions, saying he "just wants to love God." [10] [11] He tries to understand God through the lens of each religion and comes to recognize benefits in each one.
Shifting government policies lead to a decision by Pi's father to sell the zoo and emigrate with his wife and two sons to Canada . The second part of the novel begins with Pi's family aboard the Tsimtsum, the Japanese freighter that is transporting animals from their zoo to North America . A few days out of port from Manila , the ship encounters a storm and sinks. Pi manages to escape in a small lifeboat , only to learn that the boat also holds a spotted hyena , an injured Grant's zebra , and an orangutan . To Pi's distress, the hyena soon kills the zebra and then the orangutan. At this point Pi learns that a 450-pound Bengal tiger has been hiding under the boat's tarpaulin : Richard Parker, who had boarded the lifeboat with ambivalent assistance from Pi himself. The tiger kills and eats the hyena.
Frightened, Pi constructs a small raft out of rescue flotation devices, tethers it to the stern of the boat and retreats to it. He begins conditioning Richard Parker to take a submissive role by using food as a positive reinforcer and seasickness as a punishment mechanism while using a whistle for signals. Pi asserts himself as the alpha animal and is eventually able to share the boat with Richard Parker.
Pi recounts various events while adrift in the Pacific Ocean . At his lowest point, exposure renders him blind, feeble and unable to catch fish. In a state of delirium he talks with a marine "echo" that he eventually identifies as Richard Parker finally speaking up, then identifies as another survivor on another lifeboat who is also blinded by exposure and dying. They share dreams of food. The other voice speaks with a French accent and prefers meat to the vegetarian fare Pi longs for. Pi welcomes this "brother" aboard his boat. The other person moves to attack and eat Pi but is instead devoured by Richard Parker, who springs out at him from under the tarpaulin. Later, his sight restored, Pi's boat comes ashore on a floating island network of algae and inhabited by meerkats . Pi gains strength but his discovery that the island's plant life is carnivorous forces him to return to the boat. Two hundred and twenty-seven days after the ship's sinking, the lifeboat washes onto a beach in Mexico. Richard Parker disappears into the nearby jungle without a glance back.
The third part of the novel describes a conversation between Pi and two officials from the Japanese Ministry of Transport who are conducting an inquiry into the shipwreck. They meet him at the hospital in Mexico where he is recovering. Pi tells them his tale but the officials reject it as unbelievable. Pi then offers them a second story in which he is adrift on a lifeboat not with zoo animals, but with the ship's cook, a Taiwanese sailor with a broken leg, and his own mother. The cook amputates the sailor's leg for use as fishing bait , then kills the sailor and Pi's mother for food. Pi then kills the cook and dines on him.
The officials note parallels between the two stories and conclude that the hyena symbolizes the cook, the zebra the sailor, the orangutan Pi's mother, and the tiger Pi. Pi points out that neither story can be proven and neither explains the cause of the shipwreck. He asks the officials which story they prefer. They choose the story with the animals. Pi thanks them and says "And so it goes with God."
Major themes
Life is a story
Life of Pi, according to Yann Martel, can be summarized in three statements- "Life is a story... You can choose your story... A story with God is the better story." [12] A recurring theme throughout the novel seems to be believability. Pi at the end of the book asks the two investigators "If you stumble about believability, what are you living for?" [13] According to Gordon Houser there are two main themes of the book: "that all life is interdependent, and that we live and breathe via belief." [14]
Growth through adversity
PBS has described Martel's story as one of "personal growth through adversity." [15] The main character learns that "tigers are dangerous" at a young age when his father forces him to watch the zoo's Royal Bengal tiger patriarch, Mahisha, devour a live goat. Later, after he has been reduced to eking out a desperate existence on the lifeboat with the company of a fully grown tiger, Pi develops "alpha" qualities as he musters the strength, will and skills he needs to survive. [15]
Inspiration
In a 2002 interview with PBS , Martel said "I was sort of looking for a story, not only with a small 's' but sort of with a capital 'S' â€“ something that would direct my life." [16] He spoke of being lonely and needing direction in his life, and found that writing the novel met this need. [17]
Richard Parker and shipwreck narratives
The name of Martel's tiger, Richard Parker, was inspired by a character in Edgar Allan Poe 's nautical adventure novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838). The author also had in mind other occurrences of the name, including in at least two tales of shipwreck and resulting cannibalism .
Shipwreck survival tales were not uncommon in the 18th and 19th centuries. Examples include the following:
In December 1835, the ship Francis Spaight was wrecked in the north Atlantic . Survivors of the wreck were known to have practiced cannibalism in order to survive.
In January 1846, a second ship named "Francis Spaight" sank, and took a man named Richard Parker down with it. [18] [19]
In 1884, 46 years after Poe's novel was published, a shipwreck occurred with circumstances that were similar to those in his book. After the sinking of their yacht Mignonette on the way to Australia, Captain Tom Dudley and three sailors were stranded in a dinghy in the Pacific Ocean. They believed they had no choice but to eat one of the party to survive. The victim was a 17-year-old cabin boy named Richard Parker. [20] [21]
Having read about these events, Yann Martel thought, this: "So many victimized Richard Parkers had to mean something." [22] [23]
Moacyr Scliar
Martel has mentioned that a book review he read of Brazilian author Moacyr Scliar 's 1981 novella Max and the Cats accounts in part for his novel's premise. Scliar's story describes a Jewish-German refugee crossing the Atlantic Ocean with a jaguar in his boat. [24] [25] Scliar said that he was perplexed that Martel "used the idea without consulting or even informing me," and indicated that he was reviewing the situation before deciding whether to take any action in response. [26] [27] After talking with Martel, Scliar elected not to pursue the matter. [28] A dedication to Scliar "for the spark of life" appears in the author's note of Life of Pi. Literary reviews have described the similarities between Life of Pi and Max and the Cats as superficial. Reviewer Peter Yan wrote: "Reading the two books side-by-side, one realizes how inadequate bald plot summaries are in conveying the unique imaginative impact of each book," [29] and noted that Martel's distinctive narrative structure is not found in Scliar's novella. The themes of the books are also dissimilar, with Max and the Cats being an allegory for Nazism. [30] In Life of Pi, 211 of 354 pages are devoted to Pi's experience in the lifeboat, compared to Max and the Cats, in which 17 of its 99 pages depict time spent in a lifeboat. [30]
Narrative structure
According to the reviewer Peter Yan,
"'Life of Pi' is told from two alternating points of view, the main character Pi in a flashback and Yann Martel himself, who is the "visiting writer" (Martel 101) interviewing Pi many years after the cat in the boat story. This technique of the intrusive narrator adds the documentary realism to the book, setting up, like a musical counter-point, the myth-making, unreliable narrator , Pi. The reader is left to ponder at the end whether Pi's story is an allegory of another set of parallel events or vice versa." [29]
Setting
The novel is a work of fiction set in the summer of 1977 that draws on places and historical events in India. The Patel Family discussions of the political situation refer to historical events. Pondicherry is a former French colony in India. It does have an Indian Coffee House and Botanical Gardens . The Botanical Garden currently has a toy train track and a small aquarium, but it does not have a zoo. It had a zoo in 1977 but did not have any animals bigger than a deer. Munnar , the destination for the Patel family's vacation, is a small but popular hill station in Kerala . Madurai , also referenced in the novel, is a popular tourist and pilgrimage site in Tamil Nadu .
Characters
Piscine Molitor "Pi" Patel
He acquires layer after layer of diverse spirituality and brilliantly synthesizes it into a personal belief system and devotional life that is breathtaking in its depth and scope. His youthful exploration into comparative religion culminates in a magnificent epiphany of sorts.
