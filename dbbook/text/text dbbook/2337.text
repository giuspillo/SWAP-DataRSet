Plot summary
Robinton was rejected by his jealous father, Petiron, and spent most of his childhood with his nurturing mother. Since Robinton grew up in a very musically-inclined setting, all the inhabitants helped bring him along in his journey to adulthood. Robinton composed many successful songs at a very early age and was unanimously elected Masterharper, also at a relatively young age. He tried to warn the Lord Holders of the rapacity of Lord Fax , but was unsuccessful. He was present when Lessa used her wit to provoke the duel in which Lord Fax was killed by F'lar ; she had been in disguise as a drudge.
