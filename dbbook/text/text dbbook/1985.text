Case Histories is a 2004 detective novel by Kate Atkinson and set in Cambridge, England. It introduces Jackson Brodie, a former police inspector and now private investigator. The plot revolves around three seemingly unconnected family tragedies – the disappearance of a three-year-old girl from a garden; the murder of a husband with an axe; and the apparently motiveless murder of a solicitor's daughter.
