Arabian Sands is a 1959 book by explorer and travel writer Wilfred Thesiger. The book encompasses the author's travels across the Arabian Empty Quarter in the periods between 1945 and 1950, attempting to capture the lives of the Bedu People and other inhabitants of the Arabian peninsula. It is considered a classic of the travel book genre. The book largely reflects on the changes and large scale development that took place after the Second World War and the subsequent gradual erosion of traditional Bedouin ways of life that had previously existed unaltered for thousands of years. In 2008, Majid Abdulrazak (a film director from the United Arab Emirates) produced a film version of Arabian Sands which was self-funded and employed actors from the UAE and Oman in most of the major roles.
