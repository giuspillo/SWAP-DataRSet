The Art of the Metaobject Protocol (AMOP) is a 1991 book by Gregor Kiczales, Jim des Rivieres, and Daniel G. Bobrow on metaobject protocol. It contains an explanation of what a metaobject protocol is, why it is desirable, and the de facto standard for the metaobject protocol supported by many Common Lisp implementations as an extension of the Common Lisp Object System, or CLOS. It implements a simple CLOS interpreter for Lisp called "Closette". In 1997 talk at OOPSLA, Alan Kay called it "the best book written in ten years", but was dismayed that it was written in such a Lisp-oriented fashion.
