Chandagnac, now known as "Jack Shandy", must put a stop to these plans and save Beth Hurwood.
Reception
Orson Scott Card , declaring that the novel "is as good as storytelling ever gets," reported that "Powers writes in a clean, elegant style that illuminates without slowing down the tale. The story promises marvels and horrors, and delivers them all." [4] David Langford wrote that On Stranger Tides "immediately hooks you and drags you along in sympathy with one central character's appalling misfortunes on the Spanish Main, [and] escalates from there to closing mega-thrills so determinedly spiced that your palate is left almost jaded." [5]
Jack Adrian, saying that "Tim Powers has further refertilized the Sabatini swashbuckler," described the novel as a skillful blend of "high seas adventure with sorcery and black magic." [6]

On September 11, 2009, Walt Disney Pictures announced that the fourth installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean series would be titled Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides . The announcement had fueled speculation that the film would follow the plot of the novel, since Powers sold the film rights for the novel to Disney. [9] It was also speculated that Jack Sparrow would replace Jack Shandy as the story's protagonist. Powers stated that the Fountain of Youth would definitely be in the film, but Sparrow and Shandy are "totally different characters", and that Hector Barbossa and Blackbeard might overlap. [3]
In January 2010, Disney announced that the film would be released on May 20, 2011. On March 22, 2010, Jerry Bruckheimer confirmed that both Barbossa and Blackbeard would be in the film, with Blackbeard as the villain. Ian McShane portrayed Blackbeard and PenÃ©lope Cruz played his daughter, Angelica, a character that is loosely based on Beth Hurwood from the novel. [10]
