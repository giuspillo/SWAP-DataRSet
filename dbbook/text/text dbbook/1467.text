Plot summary
This story is based in the Caribbean, where Miss Marple is on holiday; her nephew paid for her to take the trip after she suffered a bout of ill health. The story starts quite slowly, and involves lots of sitting around gossiping. Miss Marple is bored and longs for something exciting to happen. She finds Major Palgrave was the man with a million stories, and everyone vacationing at the lovely Golden Palm Hotel on the Caribbean island of St. HonorÃ© tried to avoid his long-winded stories. He approaches the elderly detective, who sits, half listening and making polite replies once in a while, until Major Palgrave started speaking about her favourite topic: murder. He begins to tell her a rather unusual story about a man who got away with murder more than once, and when Palgrave asks her if she wanted to see a picture of a murderer, the knitting stops and she listens intently. But after he fishes through his wallet for the photo, he suddenly stops and changes the subject abruptly and rather loudly. Miss Marple looks up to see why and sees several people nearby.
The next day, when one of the maids, Victoria, finds Major Palgrave dead in his room, apparently from natural causes, Miss Marple becomes convinced Palgrave was murdered, but needs to see the photograph he was about to show her before something over her shoulder caused him to stop. A bottle of high blood pressure pills called Serenite is found in his bungalow. To find the murderer, Miss Marple creates a clever story to retrieve the photograph Palgrave was about to show her, she asks Dr Graham to find it, pretending it is of her nephew. Meanwhile, she interviews other people, including Tim and Molly Kendall, owners of the hotel, the Prescotts, a clergy couple, Mr Jason Rafiel, a tycoon now confined to a wheelchair suffering from a weak heart, Jackson, Rafiel's nurse, masseur attendant/valet, and Esther Walters, Mr Rafiel's secretary, the vivacious American Lucky Dyson and her caring husband Greg and Edward and Evelyn Hillingdon. On the beach when Mr Rafiel is going for a swim, Miss Marple sees Senora de Caspearo, a woman on holiday who says she remembers Major Palgrave because he had an evil eye. Miss Marple corrects her that he actually has a glass eye, but she still says that it was evil.
Victoria informs the Kendalls she did not remember seeing the serenite on Major Palgrave's table when she was tidying up in the afternoon. That night, Victoria is found stabbed to death. Molly begins having nightmares, and Miss Marple investigates. She finds Jackson in the house looking at Molly's cosmetics, saying that if belladonna was administered to it, then it would cause nightmares. The next night, Tim finds Molly unconscious on the floor, having taken an overdose of sleeping pills. The police are involved, and a cook, Enrico, tells them that he saw Molly holding a steak knife before going outside. Miss Marple asks the others if Major Palgrave told people about the photo. Others claim Palgrave said it was not a photo of a wife killer but rather a husband killer, leaving the elderly sleuth confused. Major Palgrave is exhumed and the autopsy reveals he was poisoned.
At night, Tim wakes up the hotel as his wife, Molly, is missing. They find what seems to be her body, in a creek. Miss Marple arrives and tells them that it is not Molly, but Lucky; the two resemble one another. Miss Marple wakes Mr Rafiel in the middle of the night to tell him they must prevent another death. They go to Tim and Molly Kendall's house and find Tim asking Molly to drink some wine to soothe her. Miss Marple tells Jackson to takes the wine away from Tim. She shows it to Mr Rafiel, saying there is a deadly narcotic in it. She explains that Tim Kendall is the wife killer, recognised by Major Palgrave. Miss Marple thought Palgrave saw someone on the right, where the Hillingdons and the Dysons were coming up the beach, but later she remembered that he had a glass eye so could not see on his right, but only on his left, where Tim and Molly were sitting. Tim was planning to kill his wife, but Major Palgrave recognised him and so had to be eliminated as well as Victoria, who remembered the serenite. Tim put belladonna in Molly's cosmetics to drive her mad and lead her to commit suicide. Tim asked his wife to meet him by the creek. Molly, on her way to the meeting, had a scary vision from the belladonna and wandered off. Tim saw Lucky waiting there and mistook her for Molly and killed her. He was about to poison Molly when Miss Marple came in. Esther Walters suddenly falls to Tim's knees and insists that Tim isn't a killer. Tim shouts at her to keep quiet, asking whether she wants to get him hanged. Tim had been planning to marry Esther, after Molly's death, because he had heard that she was going to inherit a large sum of money from her employer, Jason Rafiel.
Literary significance and reception
The novel is dedicated to John Cruikshank Rose, "with happy memories of my visit to the West Indies". Christie's and Max Mallowan 's friendship with John Rose started back in 1928, at the archaeological site at Ur . He was the architectural draftsman and when Max was in charge of the dig at Arpachiyah, Syria in 1932, he hired Rose to be his draftsman. Rose was Scottish, and as Christie described him, "a beautiful draughtsman, with a quiet way of talking, and a gentle humour that I found irresistible."[ citation needed ]
After lukewarm reviews of her two previous novels, Francis Iles ( Anthony Berkeley Cox ) felt that the writer was back on form in his review in The Guardian 's issue of 11 December 1964: "Mrs Agatha Christie has done it again. In A Caribbean Mystery she tells the reader explicitly what is going to happen; and yet when it does, nine out of ten will be taken completely by surprise â€“ as I was. How does she do it? For the rest, it is Miss Marple this time who is in charge of the story; and all one can guess is that the setting is a Caribbean island." [4]
Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 15 November 1964 began, "A most encouraging return to somewhere very near her best unputdownable form. ... Suspicion nicely distributed among guests, many of them raffish adulterers. Not very hard to guess, but quite suspenseful. Good varied characterisation including a particularly excellent octogenarian tycoon." [5] Towards the end of the year, Richardson again commented on the book in a special Books of the Year: A Personal Choice column when he said, "Agatha Christie makes one of those gratifying veteran's comebacks." [6]
The Daily Mirror of 21 November 1964 wrote: "Not quite at the top of her form. A Miss Marples ( sic ) story which addicts won't find as unsolvable as usual. [7]
Robert Barnard : "In the tradition of all those package-tour mysteries written by indigent crime writers who have to capitalize on their meagre holidays. Nothing much of interest, but useful for illustrating the 'fluffification' of Miss Marple. Reuses a ploy from Appointment with Death ." [8]
"There is no more cunning player of the murder game than Agatha Christie." â€” Sunday Times [9]
"Throws off the false clues and misleading events as only a master of the art can do." New York Times [ when? ] [9]

Film, TV or theatrical adaptations
A 1983 US TV movie adaptation starred Helen Hayes as Miss Marple and Barnard Hughes as Mr Rafiel.
A BBC TV adaptation starring Joan Hickson was shown in 1989 as part of the series Agatha Christie's Miss Marple , with Donald Pleasence co-starring as Mr Rafiel. Few changes were made from the novel: the Prescotts and SeÃ±ora de Caspearo were omitted, Miss Marple holidayed on Barbados rather than the fictional island of "St HonorÃ©", and the blood pressure medication was renamed Tetrauwolfide.
