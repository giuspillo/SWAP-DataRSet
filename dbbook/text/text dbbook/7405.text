A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (1926), by Henry Watson Fowler (1858–1933), is a style guide to British English usage, pronunciation, and writing. Ranging from plurals and literary technique to the distinctions among like words (homonyms, synonyms, etc. ), to the use of foreign terms, it became the standard for most style guides that followed; thus, the 1926 first edition remains in print despite the existence of the 1965 second edition, and the 1996 and 2004 printings of the third edition, which was mostly rewritten as a usage dictionary incorporating corpus linguistics data. To its users, A Dictionary of Modern English Usage is informally known by the names Fowler’s Modern English Usage, Fowler, and Fowler’s.

The title page of A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (1926)
Before writing A Dictionary of Modern English Usage, Henry Fowler and his younger brother, Francis George Fowler (1871â€“1918), wrote and revised The King's English (1906), a grammar and usage guide later superseded by this book in the 1930s. Moreover, he researched the Dictionary assisted by Francis, who died in 1918 of tuberculosis , which he contracted in service with the British Expeditionary Force in the First World War (1914â€“1918). Fowler thus dedicated the Dictionary to his brother, Francis George:
I think of it as it should have been, with its prolixities docked, its dullnesses enlivened, its fads eliminated, its truths multiplied . . . having been designed in consultation with him, it is the last fruit of a partnership that began in 1903 with our translation of Lucian . [10]
The first edition of A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (1926) was much reprinted; thus, a reprint wherein the copyright page indicates 1954, as the most recent reprinting year, also notes that the 1930 and 1937 reprintings were "with corrections". The second edition, Fowlerâ€™s Modern English Usage (1965) was revised by Sir Ernest Gowers , who updated the text, contributed entries, and deleted articles "no longer relevant to [current] literary fashions". For the twenty-first century, the third edition, The New Fowlerâ€™s Modern English Usage (1996), was revised and published as Fowlerâ€™s Modern English Usage (2004), the editor of which, Robert Burchfield , in the preface acknowledges that, while "Fowlerâ€™s name remains on the title-page . . . his book has been largely rewritten."
Historically, the substantive and editorial differences among the first-edition and the third-edition versions is that the former, A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (1926), is a prescriptive style guide to clear and expressive writing, whilst the latter versions, The New Fowlerâ€™s Modern English Usage (1996) and Fowlerâ€™s Modern English Usage (2004), are descriptive usage guides to spoken and written English. The 2009 reprinting of the 1926 first edition contains an introduction and entries updated by the linguist David Crystal .
