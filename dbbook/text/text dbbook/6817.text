It is based on his relationship with a Mexican prostitute (the title character).

This novel has been translated into Spanish by Jorge García-Robles, of Mexico City. Allen Ginsberg, in describing the book, wrote, "Tristessa's a narrative meditation studying a hen, a rooster, a dove, a cat, a dog, family meat, and a ravishing, ravished junkie lady".

He chronicles "Tristessa's" addiction to morphine and impoverished life with descriptions tinged with elements of her saintly beauty and her innocence.

These beliefs become entangled as a metaphor in the unfamiliar culture and language that Kerouac tries to grasp and make contact with in the story. The contrast between the initial reaction that the reader may have of the impoverished, marginalized life of Tristessa and the self-destructive nature of her addiction contrast with the beauty of Kerouac's descriptions. Also, as a part of the study of the life of a junkie, is the character of Old Bull Gaines - Bill Garver, in real life, a long-time friend of William S. Burroughs and other writers of the Beat Generation - who serves as both dealer and healer of Tristessa when Jack is unable to be what she needs. A movie adaptation is in the works to bring this novel to life. The screenplay is being re-worked by the American writer, Paul Magno, a recent signee to the Fondo de Cultura Económica publishing house in Mexico City. Edward Norton is slated for the role of Jack Kerouac.
