The Depths of Time is a science fiction novel by Roger McBride Allen, also the author of The Ring of Charon.
Plot introduction
Humans have invented a way of traveling great distances by creating artificial wormholes that send ships several decades into the past. A wormhole would send a ship 70 years into the past. While the crew is in hibernation the ship would travel for 70 years, covering several light years, and wakening the crew when it reached its destination, arriving only a couple of months after leaving. These wormholes are guarded by a special organization - The Chronologic Patrol - in order to prevent unauthorized travel into the past and possible time-contaminations and paradoxes.
The other major technology of humans is terraforming . Various planets have been terraformed with varying levels of success. The protagonist in order to prevent a chronological disaster, stops a terraforming crew from reaching their destination, and is blamed for causing the terraforming effort to fail. He ends up on the same planet as the refugees and must deal with the political consequences.
