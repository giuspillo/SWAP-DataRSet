Overview
A Boyâ€™s Own Story is the first of a trilogy of novels, describing a boyâ€™s coming of age and documenting a young manâ€™s experience of homosexuality in the 1950s in Cincinnati, Chicago and Michigan. The trilogy continued with The Beautiful Room Is Empty (1988) and The Farewell Symphony (1997) which brought the setting up to the 1990s.
