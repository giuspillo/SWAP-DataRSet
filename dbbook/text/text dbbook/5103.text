The Colossus of Maroussi is an impressionist travelogue by Henry Miller, which was first published in 1941 by Colt Press of San Francisco. It is set in pre-war Greece of 1939, and is ostensibly a characterization of the "Colossus" of the title, George Katsimbalis, a poet and raconteur. The work is frequently heralded as Miller's best.
Background
In 1939, Henry Miller left Paris, his home of nine years, as the events of the Second World War began to unfold. An impoverished writer in need of rejuvenation, he travelled to Greece at the invitation of his friend, the writer Lawrence Durrell , who lived in Corfu . Miller has already found his voice as an author whilst an expatriate, and had published some of his best known works, including Tropic of Cancer , Black Spring and Tropic of Capricorn . [2] The text is inspired by the events that occurred during Miller's nine months living there. Miller's evaluation is tempered by the outbreak of the Second World War, which eventually forced him to return to America in December 1939. [3] The book was written in New York , and was influenced by Miller's resentment at having to return to his native land, and his subsequent feeling of isolation. [3]
The light of Greece opened my eyes, penetrated my pores, expanded my whole being.
â€” Henry Miller [4]
Miller travels across Athens , Crete , Corfu , Poros and Delphi .
The text is ostensibly a portrait of the Greek writer George Katsimbalis (the "Colossus" of the book's title), although some critics have opined that the Colossus is more of a self-portrait of Miller himself. [5]
Critical reception
Miller considered the book to be his greatest work, and a number of critics, such as Gore Vidal and George Wickes, have agreed. [6] [3] [7] Pico Iyer describes the novel as an "ecstatic ramble". [8] Will Self depicts Miller in the novel as "a relentless fabulist who advances solipsism to the status of one of the fine arts." [9] The influence of D. H. Lawrence and Ernest Hemingway on the work has been noted. [2]
