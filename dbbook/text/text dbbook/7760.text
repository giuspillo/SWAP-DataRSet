Adventures in Time and Space was an anthology of science fiction stories edited by Raymond J. Healy and J. Francis McComas and published in 1946. When it was re-released in 1975 by Ballantine Books, Analog book reviewer Lester del Rey referred to it as a book he often gave to people in order to turn them onto the genre. It is now once again out of print. The large (997 page) anthology collected numerous stories from the Golden Age of Science Fiction, which had originally appeared in pulp magazines and are now regarded as classics of science fiction. According to Frederik Pohl, it was "A colossal achievement... the book that started the science-fiction publishing industry!" In 1954, Anthony Boucher described it as "the one anthology unarguably essential to every reader."
