Sex and the City is a collection of essays by Candace Bushnell based on her and her friends' lifestyles. It was first published in 1997, and re-published in 2001, 2006, and in 2008 as a 10th anniversary movie tie-in edition. The book is an anthology of columns that Bushnell began writing in 1994 for The New York Observer. The book was loosely adapted into a long-running HBO television series also called Sex and the City (1998–2004), which itself spawned a 2008 film of the same name and a 2010 sequel, but written under the fictional version of herself, Carrie Bradshaw.
