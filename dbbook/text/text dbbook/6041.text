Don't Bite the Sun is a 1976 science fiction novel by Tanith Lee set in a utopian world which the main character comes to reject. The main character and her friends are wild, crazy "Jang" teenagers whose lifestyle is full of reckless behavior, promiscuous sex, repeated suicide (on dying they are reborn), and a constant search for thrills. Over the course of the story, the nameless narrator fails to relate to her seven Jang friends but finds herself, feels emotion, and learns love.
Setting
On a desert planet in the distant future, humanity inhabits three domed utopian cities: Four-BEE, Four-BOO, and Four-BAA. Humans have no responsibilities; their daily needs are served by quasi-robots which even run the government through a Committee. Young humans known as "Jang" are rigidly expected to do whatever they please, indulge in various forms of drugs, have sex (as long as they marry first, even if it is just for the afternoon), and live for their own pleasures. They can visit have their dreams constructed for them, buy or steal anything they want at will, and even sabotage the city (though the robots instantly repair any damage). Robots handle everything, and nothing is left for the humans to do. Nor can they die in any meaningful sense; when they do, they are resurrected in a body customised to their wishes. [1]
Technology
In addition to being resurrected at will, the inhabitants of the city possess various future technologies. They can travel by bird plane or bubble or teleportation through a Body Displacer . Their children go to hypno-school to learn complex math that will never be used again, all while completely asleep. Their cities are completely climate-controlled. Outside the domes, however, lie uninhabitable desert, plagued with sandstorms, volcanic eruptions, and furry, long-eared beasts that wander the great expanses.
Plot
The book opens with the narrator visiting a close friend after his fortieth suicide-by-birdplane. Offended by his insensitivity, she kills herself, then, in a new body, embarks on a series of mundane attempts to amuse herself, including stealing a white fluffy desert animal that she keeps as a pet, programming elaborate dreams for herself, having unsatisfying sex with her peers, and employing a wide variety of legal drugs. Incapable of making emotional connections with anyone, she finds her life increasingly unsatisfying, though her demanding and difficult pet does interest her.
Soon after going through the mundane rituals of her life the narrator feels like she should not be a Jang teenager any more. However, the quasi-robots who run the city determine that she is not ready to become an older person. Soon she tries looking for a useful job, but to no avail: robots and computers perform every useful task. She then attempts to have a child, but is unable to find a suitable partner, tries to have a child with herself, and ends up causing the child to die. Unable to fill the emptiness she feels, she joins an expedition to explore the deserts outside the city. During this expedition, the narrator realises the beauty of life outside of the domes and she gains a strong emotional connection with her stolen pet. However, it is then accidentally killed, devastating her. Upon returning to the city, she is still unable to make lasting emotional connections with her peers. She considers death and wonders if she really belongs in the city or somewhere else. [1]

Context
Tanith Lee wrote Donâ€™t Bite the Sun in the early 1970s, and it comprises part of the New Wave of science fiction, in which feminist writers played a substantial role. [2] Fantastic fiction can be a way of describing and imperfect world that can provoke social change. Women writing science fiction as part of the New Wave â€œrecuperate[d] female archetypal roles that have fallen into stereotypes; â€¦ recover[ed] a lost matriarchal tradition in myth and history â€¦ deal[t] explicitly with woman-centered issues such as rape and gender inequality â€¦ and â€¦ reenvision[ed] traditional fantasy from a feminized perspective of caring and community.â€� [2] Don't Bite the Sun formed part of a projected trilogy (with Drinking Sapphire Wine and an unwritten third novel); such long novels and multibook series became increasingly common during the 1970s. [2] Donâ€™t Bite the Sun features considerable technology developed in the 1970s, including robots, game rooms and virtual reality, and compact computers. [3]
Tanith Lee wrote Don't Bite the Sun during the science fiction New Wave of the 1970s, but also credits feminist writers such as Elizabeth Bowen and Angela Carter as significant influences during her early career. [4] While she did not consider herself a feminist author during the period in which she wrote Don't Bite the Sun, she later acknowledged her feminist influences [5] The New Wave fascination with soul-crushing dystopian worlds is apparent in Don't Bite the Sun [5] but is subverted into an apparent soul-crushing utopia.
