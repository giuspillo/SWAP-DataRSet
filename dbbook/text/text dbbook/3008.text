The book's front features Stern dressed in drag, with the first edition back featuring a picture of Stern with O.J. Simpson at the wedding of Donald Trump in 1993. Three different versions of a paperback edition were released on October 16, 1996, that featured Stern dressed as a drag with blonde, brunette and red hair. A selection of color photographs are also included that did not appear in the first edition.

Prodigy, Michael Jackson and OCD
When asked on the book's title in a 1995 interview on Today , Stern replied with:
â€œ
When I was a kid growing up in high school , I would come down the steps. My parents were disgusted by me. I had started this growth spurt . I looked like a big, hairy pencil. I'm walking down the steps and my father would look at me and I'd be in my underpants. And he looked down at his son who was sprouting with facial hair and he'd go, 'Oh, look. There's Miss America.' [7]
