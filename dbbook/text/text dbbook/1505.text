The Stars My Destination is a science fiction novel by Alfred Bester. Originally serialized in Galaxy magazine in four parts beginning with the October 1956 issue, it first appeared in book form in the United Kingdom as Tiger! Tiger! – after William Blake's poem "The Tyger", the first verse of which is printed as the first page of the novel – and the book remains widely known under that title in markets where this edition was circulated. A working title for the novel was Hell's My Destination, and it was also associated with the name The Burning Spear.
Plot
In the 25th century, "jaunting" â€“ personal teleporation â€“ has so upset the social and economic balance that the Inner Planets are at war with the Outer Satellites. Gully Foyle of the Presteign-owned merchant spaceship Nomad â€“ an uneducated, unskilled, unambitious man whose life is at a dead end â€“ becomes a victim of the war when the ship is attacked and he alone survives. After six months of waiting for rescue, a passing spaceship, the Vorga, also owned by the powerful Presteign industrial clan, ignores his signal and abandons him. Foyle is enraged and is transformed into a man consumed by revenge, the first of many transformations.
Foyle repairs the ship, is captured by a cargo cult which tattoos a hideous mask of a tiger on his face, escapes and is returned to Terra. His attempt to blow up the Vorga fails, and he is captured by Presteign. Unknown to him, the Nomad, was carrying "PyrE", a new material which could make the difference between victory and defeat in the war. Presteign hires Saul Dagenham to interrogate Foyle and find the ship and PyrE.
Protected by his own revenge fixation, Foyle cannot be broken, and he is put into a jaunte-proof prison, where he meets Jisbella McQueen, who teaches him to think clearly, and tells him he should find out who gave the order not to rescue him. Together they escape and get his tattoos removed â€“ but not with total success: the markings come back when Foyle becomes too emotional. They then head out to the Nomad, where they recover not only PyrE, but a fortune in platinum. Jiz is captured by Dagenham, but Foyle escapes.
Some time later, Foyle re-emerges as "Geoffrey Fourmyle," a nouveau riche dandy. Foyle has rigorously educated himself and had his body altered to become a killing machine. Through yoga he has achieved the self-control necessary to prevent his stigmata from showing. He seeks out Robin Wednesbury, a one-way telepath , and convinces her to help him charm his way through high society.
Foyle tracks down the crew of the Vorga to learn the identity of the ship's captain, but each is implanted with a death-reflex and dies when questioned. Each time, Foyle is tormented by the appearance of "The Burning Man", an image of himself on fire.
At a society party, Foyle is smitten with Presteign's daughter Olivia. He also meets Jisabella again â€“ now Dagenham's lover â€“ who chooses not to reveal Foyle's identity, although Dagenham has realized it anyway. Then, during a nuclear attack by the Outer Satellites, Foyle goes to Olivia to save her. She tells him that to have her, he must be as cruel and ruthless as she is.
Robin, traumatized by the attack, tries to buy her way out of her arrangement with Foyle with the name of another Vorga crew member. Foyle agrees, but immediately reneges. In response, Robin goes to Central Intelligence to betray him.
Foyle learns that the captain of the Vorga had has all her sensory nerves disabled and is thus immune to conventional torture, and that the ship did not rescue him because it was picking up refugees, taking their belongings, and scuttling them into space. He kidnaps a telepath to interrogate the captain, and learns that Olivia Presteign was the person in charge. Olivia rescues him from commandos , as she sees in Foyle someone who can match her hatred and need to destroy.
Driven by a guilty conscience , Foyle tries to give himself up, but is captured by Presteign's lawyer, who turns out to be a spy for the Outer Satellites. He tells Foyle that when the Nomad was attacked, Foyle was taken off the ship, transported 600,000 miles away, and set adrift in a spacesuit be a decoy to attract ships to be ambushed. Instead, Foyle space-jaunted â€“ a previously unknown possibility â€“ back to the Nomad. Now, the Outer Satellites not only want PyrE, they want Foyle as well, to find out the secret of space-jaunting.
Meanwhile, Presteign reveals that PyrE is activated by telepathy, and Robin is enlisted to trigger it and flush out Foyle. Bits of PyrE â€“ left exposed by Foyle's tests into its purpose â€“ cause destruction worldwide, but primarily at Foyle's abandoned encampment in St. Patrick's Cathedral , where the lawyer has brought him. The building collapses partially, killing the lawyer and trapping Foyle, unconscious but alive, over a pit of flame. Suffering from synesthesia brought on by the explosion affecting his neurological implants, Foyle jauntes through space and time as The Burning Man. Finally he lands in the future, where Robin telepathically tells him how to escape from the collapsing cathedral.
Back in the present, Foyle is pressured to surrender the rest of the PyrE, which was protected from exploding by its Inert Lead Isotope container, and to teach mankind how to space-jaunte. He leads them to where the rest of the PyrE is hidden, but makes off with it and jauntes across the globe, throwing slugs of PyrE into the crowd at each stop. "I've given life and death back to the people who do the living and dying," he says. He asks humanity to choose: either destroy itself or follow him into space.
He now realizes the key to space-jaunting is faith: not the certainty of an answer, but the conviction that somewhere an answer exists. He jauntes from one nearby star to another, finding new worlds suitable for colonization, but reachable only if he shares the secret of space-jaunting. He comes to rest back with the cargo cult, where the people see him as a holy man and await his revelation.
Speculative science
The novel included some notable early descriptions of proto-science and fictional technology, among them Bester's portrayal of psionics , [8] including the phenomenon of "jaunting", named after the scientist (Charles Fort Jaunte) who discovered it. Jaunting is the instantaneous teleportation of one's body (and anything one is wearing or carrying). One is able to move up to a thousand miles by just thinking. This suddenly revealed and near-universal ability totally disrupts the economic balance between the Inner Planets (Venus, Earth, Mars, and the Moon) and the Outer Satellites (various moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune), eventually leading to a war between the two. Jaunting has other effects on the social fabric of the novel's world, and these are examined in true science-fictional fashion. Women of the upper classes are locked away in jaunte-proof rooms "for their protection", the treatment of criminals of necessity goes back to the Victorian " separate system ", and freaks and monsters abound.
The second significant technology in the novel is the rare substance known as "PyrE", a weapon powerful enough to win an interplanetary war.
Bester's description of synesthesia is the first popular account in the English language. It is also quite accurate. [9]
Reception and influence
Initially, reviews of the novel were mixed. The well-regarded science fiction writer and critic Damon Knight , in In Search of Wonder (1956), [10] wrote of the novel's "bad taste, inconsistency, irrationality, and downright factual errors", but called the ending of the book "grotesquely moving". In a profile of Bester for Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature (2005), critic Steven H. Gale cited the novel as a reflection of the author's maturation, addressing as it does "the continued evolution of humankind as a species", a grander theme than those treated with in his earlier work. [1] Gale furthermore declared the novel to be Bester's most stylistically ambitious work, citing the use of disparate fonts to evoke synaesthesia, the progressively intelligent language accorded to the maturing protagonist, and the framing of the narrative between the variations on Blake's quatrain. [1]
More recently, the book has received high praise from several science fiction writers. By 1987, when the author died, "It was apparent that the 1980s genre [ cyberpunk ] owed an enormous debt to Bester â€“ and to this book in particular," Neil Gaiman wrote in the introduction to a 1999 edition of the book. "The Stars My Destination is, after all, the perfect cyberpunk novel: it contains such cheerfully protocyber elements as multinational corporate intrigue; a dangerous, mysterious, hyperscientific McGuffin (PyrE); an amoral hero; a supercool thief-woman ..." [2] James Lovegrove called it "the very best of Bester", [11] and Thomas M. Disch identified it as "one of the great sf novels of the 1950s". [11] "Our field has produced only a few works of actual genius, and this is one of them," wrote Joe Haldeman . [11] who added that he reads the novel "every two or three years and it still evokes a sense of wonder." According to Samuel R. Delany , the book is "considered by many to be the greatest single SF novel". [11] while Robert Silverberg wrote that it is "on everybody's list of the ten greatest SF novels". [2] Fantasy writer Michael Moorcock praised it as "a wonderful adventure story" that embodies truly libertarian principles. [12] In a 2011 survey asking leading science fiction writers to name their favourite work of the genre, The Stars My Destination was the choice of William Gibson and Moorcock. Gibson remarked that the book was "perfectly surefooted, elegantly pulpy," and "dizzying in its pace and sweep", and a "talisman" for him in undertaking his first novel. Moorcock hailed Bester's novel as a reminder of "why the best science fiction still contains, as in Ballard , vivid imagery and powerful prose coupled to a strong moral vision". [13]
In 2012 the novel was included in the Library of America two-volume boxed set American Science Fiction: Nine Classic Novels of the 1950s, edited by Gary K. Wolfe . [14]
Adaptations
Howard Chaykin and Byron Preiss did a graphic adaptation the first half of which was published in 1979 by Baronet Publishing and the complete version â€“ delayed due to Baronet's bankruptcy after releasing the original version â€“ by Marvel Entertainment 's Epic imprint in 1992. [15]
A dramatisation titled Tiger! Tiger! was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on September 14, 1991 and repeated on August 16, 1993. It was scripted by Ivan Benbrook and directed by Andy Jordan. Alun Armstrong played Gully Foyle, Miranda Richardson was Olivia, Siobhan Redmond was Robin Wednesbury and Lesley Manville was Jisbella McQueen. [16] Although the novel has long been considered an "unfilmable" science fiction work, [17] the screen rights were reported in 2006 to have been acquired by Universal Pictures . [18]
In popular culture
Stephen King refers to The Stars My Destination in several works. In Lisey's Story (2006), the title character recalls it as her deceased husband's favorite novel. The short story " The Jaunt " (1981) takes its title from the book, and explicitly names and references it at several points.
Gully Foyle makes a cameo appearance as an agent for the Jurisfiction organisation in the BookWorld of author Jasper Fforde 's Thursday Next series. Another novel in the series, The Well of Lost Plots , uses Stars My Destination as the title of a tabloid newspaper in the fictional universe of Emperor Zhark.
The novel inspired the song "Tiger! Tiger!" by the heavy metal band Slough Feg which appeared on their 2007 album Hardworlder , the cover of which depicts Gully Foyle.
"The Stars Our Destination" is the name of a song on the 1994 Stereolab album Mars Audiac Quintet .
The British TV Series The Tomorrow People uses Jaunting to refer to teleportation.
In the 2000 video game Deus Ex , Gully Foyle is listed as a current resident of the 'Ton Hotel.
The character "Enzo Paulo Gugino" in John Scalzi 's novel Zoe's Tale wrote a poem entitled "The Stars My Destination" based on "the title from an obscure fantasy adventure book that he'd never read but whose title stayed with him."
