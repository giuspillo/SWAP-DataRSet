The Ghost from the Grand Banks is a 1990 science fiction novel written by Arthur C. Clarke ( ISBN 0-575-04906-5 ).
The story deals with two groups, both of whom are attempting to raise one of the halves of the wreck of Titanic from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean in time for the sinking's centennial in 2012.
Chapter 7 is an editorial from the April 15, 2007 London Times which urges that the Titanic be left alone: "There is no need to revisit her to be reminded of the most important lesson the Titanic can teachâ€”the dangers of over-confidence, of technological hubris." As the plot develops, Clarke moves events through complications that echo the editorial.
The phrase Ghost from the Grand Banks was also used in an earlier Clarke book, Imperial Earth , also regarding a recovered Titanic.
