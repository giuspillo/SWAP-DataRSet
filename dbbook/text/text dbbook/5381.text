Plot summary
The story follows the lives of twelve people who lived in the same area of England over a period of 6000 years, and how their lives link to one anotherâ€™s. Each chapter carries the reader forward in time, but circles around the centre of Northampton, drawing in historical events and touchstones, before finally segueing into metafictional narrative in the closing chapter, as the author himself comments directly upon the previous chapterâ€™s ambiguous closing line, before relating a personal (possibly fictional) anecdote about Northampton which relates a personal experience of local myth, and features an appearance by his daughter and son-in-law, the writers Leah Moore and John Reppion . Throughout, the image of the fire sparks resonates between the tales, while Moore finds a different voice for each character â€“ though most are inherently duplicitous in some manner, leading to a further commentary on the disparity between myth and reality, and which is more likely to endure over time.
