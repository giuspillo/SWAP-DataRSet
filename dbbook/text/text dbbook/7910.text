Premise
He describes nature as a force previously independent of human beings, but which is now directly affected by the actions of people. [1]
"If the waves crash up against the beach, eroding dunes and destroying homes, it is not the awesome power of Mother Nature . It is the awesome power of Mother Nature as altered by the awesome power of man, who has overpowered in a century the processes that have been slowly evolving and changing of their own accord since the earth was born." [3]
He offers two paths forward: "The Defiant Reflex" or a "more humble" way of living. [4]
