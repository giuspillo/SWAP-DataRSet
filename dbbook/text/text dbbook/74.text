Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is a 1974 spy novel by British author John le Carré, featuring George Smiley. Smiley is a taciturn, middle-aged intelligence officer who has been forced into retirement. He is recalled to hunt down a Soviet mole in the "Circus", the highest echelon of the British Secret Intelligence Service. In keeping with le Carré's work, the narrative begins in medias res with the repatriation of a captured British spy. The background is supplied during the book through a series of flashbacks.
Chronology
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is the first novel of the Karla Trilogy, the second and third novels being The Honourable Schoolboy (1977) and Smiley's People (1979), later published in an omnibus edition as The Quest for Karla (1982). These are the fifth, sixth, and seventh le CarrÃ© spy novels featuring George Smiley. Three characters who are important players in TTSS first appeared in le CarrÃ©'s very first book, Call for the Dead (1961). They are George Smiley, Peter Guillam, and Inspector Mendel.
Title
Control , chief of the Circus, assigns the code names "Tinker," "Tailor," "Soldier," "Poor Man," and "Beggar Man" to five senior intelligence officers at the Circus. He suspects that one of the five, whose identity is unknown, is a Soviet mole. Control assigns these code names with the intention that, should an agent named Prideaux uncover information about the identity of the mole, Prideaux can relay it back to the Circus using an easy-to-recall codename. The names are derived from the English children's rhyme " Tinker, Tailor ":
    Tinker, Tailor,
    Rich Man, Poor Man,
    Beggar Man, Thief.
The code name "Sailor" is not used as it sounds too much like "Tailor" and Control drops "Rich Man," resulting in Toby Esterhase being code-named "Poor Man." George Smiley is "Beggar Man."
Plot
In 1972, Control , the head of British Intelligence ("the Circus"), sends agent Jim Prideaux to Czechoslovakia to meet a Czech general who wishes to sell information. The operation is blown and a fleeing Prideaux is shot in the back by Soviet intelligence. Amid the international incident that follows, Control and his deputy, George Smiley , are forced into retirement. Control, already ill, dies soon afterwards.
Through a love affair in Hong Kong with Irina, the wife of a Moscow Centre intelligence officer, British agent Ricki Tarr discovers that there may be a high-ranking Soviet mole, code-named "Gerald," within the Circus. After going into hiding to avoid Soviet agents, Tarr alerts his immediate superior, Peter Guillam , who in turn notifies Undersecretary Oliver Lacon, the Civil Service officer responsible for overseeing the Intelligence Services. Lacon enlists Smiley to investigate. Smiley and Guillam must investigate without the knowledge of the Circus, which is headed by Sir Percy Alleline and his deputies â€“ Bill Haydon , Toby Esterhase , and Roy Bland â€“ as any of these could be the mole.
Smiley suspects that Gerald was responsible for the failure of Operation Testify, the mission which led to the torture of Prideaux and the disgrace of Control. Prideaux, who was repatriated and dismissed from the Circus, reveals to Smiley that Control suspected the mole's existence, and that the true aim of Testify was to learn the mole's identity from the Czech general. Prideaux reveals that the Moscow Centre personnel who interrogated him already knew this, and it became clear to Smiley that the operation was a trap set by Moscow Centre to discredit Control and remove the threat to Gerald.
Alleline, who was Control's rival, has risen to head the Circus as a result of seemingly top-grade Soviet intelligence from a source code-named "Merlin". The Merlin material is handled by a secret committee, consisting of Alleline and his deputies, in an operation called Witchcraft. Smiley's investigation leads him to believe that the Merlin source is false, and is being used by Moscow Centre to influence the leadership of the Circus. Cleverly, Moscow Centre has induced the Circus leadership to believe that Merlin maintains his cover in Moscow by feeding the Russians low-grade intelligence from a false Circus mole. As a result, the leaders of the Circus suppress any rumours of a mole, thereby protecting the actual mole; meanwhile, the "chicken feed" is given by Merlin in return for valuable intelligence, "the Crown Jewels."
Smiley pressures Esterhase into confessing his role in feeding intelligence to "Merlin," and into revealing the location of the safe house where Gerald and his Soviet handler meet. Tarr is dispatched to Paris to send a personal message to Alleline, who alerts the Witchcraft committee and thus forces Gerald to seek an emergency meeting with his handler at the safe house. Smiley and Guillam break in on the meeting, and Gerald is revealed to be Haydon, a respected colleague and former friend who once had an affair with Smiley's now estranged wife, Ann. Haydon acknowledges he was recruited several decades previously by Karla , the Moscow Centre spymaster.
Alleline is removed, and Smiley is appointed temporary head of Circus to deal with the fallout. Haydon is to be exchanged with the Soviet Union for several of the agents he betrayed, but, shortly before he is due to leave England, is mysteriously killed while in custody. Though his killer is not explicitly revealed, it is strongly implied to be Prideaux, his old partner, whom he betrayed in Operation Testify.

Jargon
The characters in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy use a great deal of spy jargon which is presented as the authentic insiderspeak of British Intelligence. Le Carre has said that, with the exception of a few terms like "mole" and "legend," this jargon was his own invention. [2] Examples are:
Term
Definition [2]
Agent
An espionage agent or spy; a citizen who is recruited by a foreign government to spy on his own country. This term should not be confused with a member of an intelligence service who recruits spies; they are referred to as intelligence officers or more particularly case officers.
