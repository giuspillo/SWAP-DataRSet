Plot summary
The Far Side of the World continues the story of Jack Aubrey's exploits during the War of 1812 . Aubrey reports to his commander-in-chief at Gibraltar , who sends him and HMS Surprise to intercept the American frigate USS Norfolk. The American ship is under orders to attack British whalers in the South Seas . Jack makes all haste to have the Surprise victualled as quickly as possible and recruits a new master, a Mr Allen. Not only is Allen an excellent seaman but he also has an in-depth knowledge of whalers, having sailed previously with James Colnett on a semi exploration-whaling expedition to the South Atlantic. Stephen Maturin also persuades Jack to take Mr Martin along with them, a clergyman who Jack approves of and who is unhappy with his current ship. During the process of supplying the ship, Aubrey is met with Mr. Hollom an aging midshipman without the talent to go much further in the Navy but with few prospects elsewhere. The desperate Hollom pleads with Jack for a spot in his midshipmans berth. Aubrey initially denies Hollom but, in pity for the sad state of his affairs, relents and gives him a spot.
Maturin receives disturbing news from his intelligence-chief in London, Sir Joseph Blaine, which tends to confirm his suspicions of treason and infiltration by the French. He also hears from his wife, who has heard rumours of the infidelity he pretended in Valletta , Malta with the red-haired Mrs Fielding for intelligence reasons. He sends a letter to reassure her via Andrew Wray, unaware of the latter's role as a French agent.
The Surprise encounters many setbacks, suffering delays in Brazil from a lightning-struck prow before they round Cape Horn into the Pacific Ocean to locate the Norfolk, which has captured and burnt several whalers. An illicit affair is begun between the sweet singing but otherwise untalented Hollom and the pretty wife brought aboard by the sexually impotent gunner, Horner. Stephen soon becomes embroiled in these unhappy circumstances when the gunner comes to him for help as well as later when Mrs. Horner is found to be pregnant. Maturin refuses to perform an abortion so Mrs Horner turns to his assistant. Maturin learns of this and is livid, threatening the assistant with vile punishment once they return to land. Later the assistant disappears and it is presumed that the gunner, having learned of the procedure, has hefted him overboard in the night. Because of the many setbacks and the general knowledge of the affair feelings toward Hollom turn bad and he is soon considered a " Jonah " by the crew - someone who brings bad luck to the ship. As the ship stops at the Juan FernÃ¡ndez Islands for re-provisioning the two lovers are seen ashore in the company of the gunner. Later the gunner returns alone and the two lovers are never seen again - they are presumed to have been beaten to death by the ferocious, brutal and jealous husband whilst the Surprise was being provisioned. Horner begins drinking even more heavily than before and sinks into a black despair. He is later discovered hanged in his cabin.
The crew of the Surprise, having nearly been shipwrecked by the tail of a typhoon , finally discover the Norfolk wrecked on a reef by the same typhoon and her crew encamped on an island. Aubrey, Mr Martin and some of the crew take Stephen ashore as he is in a coma after hitting his head in a fall during the typhoon. While needs to be on land to be operated on, since he is the surgeon and his assistant has disappeared, there is no one in the English crew competent to do it. However, he makes a recovery without an operation. While they are ashore, another heavy storm blows the Surprise away and they are stranded. Relations between the two marooned groups deteriorate rapidly, particularly after Jack announces to the American Captain Palmer that he will have to take his crew prisoner. Some of them are from HMS Hermione , a ship that mutinied in the West Indies and they know they will be hanged if returned to British authorities. The situation reaches a crisis point after Jack orders the crew of the Surprise to lengthen their boat so they can sail away, pushing them particularly hard when he sees an American whaler on the horizon. The crew of the Norfolk sabotage the boat after spotting the same whaler but it is at this point that they see her strike her colours , having been pursued through a gap in the reef by the Surprise.
