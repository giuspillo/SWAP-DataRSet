The New Biographical Dictionary of Film is a reference book written by film critic David Thomson and originally published by Martin Secker & Warburg Ltd in 1975 under the title Biographical Dictionary of Cinema. Organized by personality, it is an exhaustive inventory of those involved in international cinema, whether contemporary or historical, elite or esoteric. Beyond its scope, the tome is most notable for infusing subjectivity into its fact-based form; the technique may best be described as a playful deconstruction of the "reference book. " It is currently available in its fifth edition, released in October 2010.
Overview
Fourth edition press notes from Random House :
For almost thirty years, David Thomsonâ€™s Biographical Dictionary of Film has been not merely â€œthe finest reference book ever written about moviesâ€� (Graham Fuller, Interview), not merely the â€œdesert island bookâ€� of art critic David Sylvester, not merely â€œa great, crazy masterpieceâ€� (Geoff Dyer, The Guardian), but also â€œfiendishly seductiveâ€� (Greil Marcus, Rolling Stone).
This new edition updates the older entries and adds 30 new ones: Darren Aronofsky, Emmanuelle BÃ©art, Jerry Bruckheimer, Larry Clark, Jennifer Connelly, Chris Cooper, Sofia Coppola, Alfonso Cuaron, Richard Curtis, Sir Richard Eyre, Sir Michael Gambon, Christopher Guest, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, Spike Jonze, Wong Kar-Wai, Laura Linney, Tobey Maguire, Michael Moore, Samantha Morton, Mike Myers, Christopher Nolan, Dennis Price, Adam Sandler, Kevin Smith, Kiefer Sutherland, Charlize Theron, Larry Wachowski and Andy Wachowski, Lew Wasserman, Naomi Watts, and Ray Winstone.
In all, the book includes more than 1300 entries, some of them just a pungent paragraph, some of them several thousand words long. In addition to the new â€œmusts,â€� Thomson has added key figures from film historyâ€“lively anatomies of Graham Greene, Eddie Cantor, Pauline Kael, Abbott and Costello, NoÃ«l Coward, Hoagy Carmichael, Dorothy Gish, Rin Tin Tin, and more.
Here is a great, rare book, one that encompasses the chaos of art, entertainment, money, vulgarity, and nonsense that we call the movies. Personal, opinionated, funny, daring, provocative, and passionate, it is the one book that every filmmaker and film buff must own. Time Out named it one of the ten best books of the 1990s. Gavin Lambert recognized it as â€œa work of imagination in its own right.â€� Now better than everâ€“a masterwork by the man playwright David Hare called â€œthe most stimulating and thoughtful film critic now writing.â€� [3]
Although it looks very much like a dictionary or encyclopedia, each of the book's approximately 5,000 brief biographical sketches is highly subjective: a typical entry may begin with a birthplace and filmography but always concludes with something closer to criticism and memoir as the author examines his connection to the subject's career both academically and personally.
Thomsonâ€™s entry on Tom Cruise , for example, opens by considering the actorâ€™s age, recognizing that detractors see him as â€œrepresentative of all that is most immature in American cinema today.â€� Thomson notes that Clark Gable was a rising star at thirty: â€œNow, in our collective recollection, Gable may seem older, worldlier, and more grown-up than Cruise was at thirty. But when did Gable ever risk playing the jerk to whom Cruise was totally committed in The Color of Money ? When was Gable as uninhibitedly tender as Cruise managed in Risky Business ? And could Gable have survived the black-hole narcissism of Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man ?â€� The entry closes with the actorâ€™s late-90s comeback, calling his work in Magnolia , â€œhis most searching and self-critical performance,â€� and abandoning objectivity altogether: â€œSo, after bad years, I remain hopeful, even if all the [Mission:] 'Impossibles' put a greater load on things that might be.â€� [4]
History
The Martin Secker & Warburg Ltd -published first editionâ€”the 600-page Biographical Dictionary of Cinema [1] â€”was followed by Biographical Dictionary of Film, published by William Morrow & Co in June, 1980; [5] the third, entitled A Biographical Dictionary of Film, would be released on November 17, 1994, by Andre Deutsch Ltd . 328 pages longer than the first edition, it added 200 new entries including Molly Ringwald . [6]
The 2004 edition was a major overhaul. Although the book's first edition contained a mere 600 pages, the fourth would overflow with 1,080, updating older entries and adding 30 new personalities. The book's cover art was reworked and the word "new" was added to its title. [3]
Fifth edition
The fifth edition, released October 26, 2010, appeared to be a reworking akin to the 2004 update. The cover art has been reworked ( There Will Be Blood replaces To Have and Have Not ) along with a swell of new entries (over 100 in all, including Judd Apatow and Mark Wahlberg ).
Random House's fifth edition press release:
In its fifth edition, and with more than 100 new entriesâ€”from Judd Apatow to Mark Wahlbergâ€”the classic, beloved film book, better than ever.
For thirty-five years, David Thomsonâ€™s Biographical Dictionary of Film has been not merely â€œthe finest reference book ever written about moviesâ€� (Graham Fuller, Interview), not merely â€œa great, crazy masterpieceâ€� (Geoff Dyer, The Guardian), but also â€œfiendishly seductiveâ€� (Greil Marcus, Rolling Stone). For this edition, Thomson has updated and in some cases recast every biography, and has added 100 new entries (Clive Owen, Scarlett Johansson, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Heath Ledger, for example). The book now includes almost 1,500 entries, some of them just a pungent paragraph, some of them several thousand words long, every one a gem.
Here is a great, rare book that encompasses the chaos of art, entertainment, money, vulgarity, and nonsense that we call the movies. Personal, opinionated, funny, daring, provocative, and passionate, it is the one book that every filmmaker and film buff must own. [7]
