Paris to the Moon is a book of essays by The New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik. The essays detail life in Paris, France by a North American transplant and explain the difference in culture, including the differences in physical fitness attitudes (the French do not obsess the way Americans and Canadians do). Another essay called "The Rookie" details how Gopnik's child, taken to France as a baby, grows up with no knowledge of baseball. Gopnik repeatedly attempts to explain the game to his son throughout the book. This essay was later recorded for the public radio program This American Life by Gopnik himself. Gopnik later moved back to the United States, giving his son the opportunity to grow up seeing and playing baseball.
