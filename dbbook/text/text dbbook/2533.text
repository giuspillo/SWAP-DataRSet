City of Night is a novel written by John Rechy. It was originally published in 1963 in New York by Grove Press.

Plot summary
Set in the 1960s, the book follows the travels of a young man (Rechy uses the term â€œyoungmanâ€� when referring to hustlers) across the country while working as a hustler. The book focuses chapters on locations that the boy visits and certain personages he meets there, from New York City , to Los Angeles , San Francisco and New Orleans . Throughout the novel, the unnamed narrator has trysts with various peculiar characters, including another hustler, an older man, an S&M enthusiast and a bed-ridden old man. All of these relationships range in the extent of their emotional and sexual nature, as well as in their peculiarity.
Reception and influences
The narrator shares many characteristics, including his ethnicity and relative age, with the author at the time. The author uses curious methods to achieve verisimilitude , for instance, omitting the apostrophe in contractions, in order to recreate the speech of characters who are barely literate.
The book has been noted as an influence by The Doors . A curious object of note is the reference to â€œCity of Nightâ€� in L.A. Woman . The Los Angeles based portion of the book relies heavily on characters who are drag queens and transgender , which would seem to leave the object of the song as sexually ambiguous.
City of Night also influenced Gus Van Sant to write My Own Private Idaho .
City of Night was ranked number 22 on a list of the best 100 gay and lesbian novels compiled by The Publishing Triangle in 1999. [2]
