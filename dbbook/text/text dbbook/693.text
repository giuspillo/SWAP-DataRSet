Flambards is a novel for children or young adults by K. M. Peyton, first published by Oxford in 1967 with illustrations by Victor Ambrus. Alternatively, "Flambards" is the trilogy (1967–1969) or series (1967–1981) named for its first book. The series is set in England just before, during, and after World War I. The novel Flambards (book one) features a teenage orphan and heiress Christina Parsons, who comes to live at Flambards, the impoverished Essex estate owned by her crippled and tyrannical uncle, William Russell, and his two sons, Mark and Will.

For The Edge of the Cloud, Peyton won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association , recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject . [3] She was a commended runner-up for both the first and third books, the latter in competition with her Medal-winning work. [4] [a]
She also won the 1970 Guardian Children's Fiction Prize , conferred by The Guardian newspaper and judged by a panel of British children's writers. [5] Ordinarily the prize recognises one fiction book published during the preceding calendar year; exceptionally Peyton won for the Flambards trilogy completed in 1969. [6] [b]
The trilogy was adapted as a 13-part television series in 1979, Flambards starring Christine McKenna as Christina Parsons.
World Publishing issued a U.S. edition of the first book in 1968, retaining the Ambrus illustrations. [2] World (Cleveland and New York) also published U.S. editions of the second and third books in 1969 and 1970, also with the original illustrations, although all three novels were reset with a greater page-counts.
