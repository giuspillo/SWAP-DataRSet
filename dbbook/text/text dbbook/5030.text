YÅ«ma is the main protagonist in the story. He has a nice, helping personality and is not afraid to help girls in need. His two close friends are Hachisuke Takamizo, and Jun Watarase, who seems to have a crush on him. When he was younger he was able to do some magic in order to help Haruhi who was being bullied, but now he professes that he cannot use magic (though in reality he still can). Additionally, he seems to be put off by the notion of using magic whatsoever, even if it is able to help people. Eventually, he realizes that magic can bring happiness if used in the right way and transfers to the magic section. In the end, he learned that his real mother is Suzuri Minagi (a teacher in the magic section). He is actually one of a kind and one of the most powerful and quickest of learners when it comes to magic, although he doesn't use it because of a few accidents when he was younger and because his mother erased his memory when he was young. He eventually started to harbour feelings for Haruhi Kamisaka.
Haruhi Kamisaka (ç¥žå�‚ æ˜¥å§«, Kamisaka Haruhi ? )
Voiced by: Yui Sakakibara
Haruhi is the main heroine in the story. She is a mage in training and is seen as very skilled amongst her peers, who have been known to think of her as a genius when it comes to using magic. When she was younger, YÅ«ma was able to use some magic in order to help her from some bullies which made her want to become a mage herself. Her magic wand is named soprano (ã‚½ãƒ—ãƒ©ãƒŽ, Sopurano ? ), which owes its form from a trumpet that Haruhi used to play before she started to study magic. She harbours feelings for Yuma Kohinata. She was mistaken by Ibuki Shikimori to be the daughter of "that" woman (the woman who stole the Shikimori treasure) and even tried to control her to break the barrier that seals the treasure in the Shikimori Forest. In the end, she got together with Yuma when he was transferred to the Magic Section.
Anri Hiiragi (æŸŠ æ��ç’ƒ, Hiiragi Anri ? )
Voiced by: Mia Naruse
Anri is Haruhi's close friend and also a fellow mage in training. She tends to have a very strong-willed type of personality which she uses to try to get the things she wants. It can also make her reckless when it comes to her using magic, due to her being overconfident and underskilled compared to Haruhi. She is left handed according to the seventh anime episode. Her magic wand is named Paella (ãƒ‘ã‚¨ãƒªã‚¢, Paeria ? ) and was formed from her favorite feathered pen. She applied for a part-time job as a waitress in the Oasis cafeteria to save some money for her to be able to go abroad and study at a Magic Institution. Eventually, she begins working for Otoha Kohinata in the school's cafeteria.
Koyuki Takamine (é«˜å³° å°�é›ª, Takamine Koyuki ? )
Voiced by: Yura Hinata
Koyuki is a friend of Haruhi and Anri who is one year above them and is also in the magic section. Her magic wand is named Sphere Tom (ã‚¹ãƒ•ã‚£ã‚¢ã‚¿ãƒ , Sufia Tamu ? ) though it is also known to be nicknamed "Tama-chan" (ã‚¿ãƒžã�¡ã‚ƒã‚“ ? ). It takes the form of a staff with a small green sphere on the end that floats on the staff. Unlike the other magic wands featured that can speak spiritually, sphere Tom has a face from which to voice its opinions. Koyuki inherited the craft of making "Tama-chan"s and puts a lot of effort not only into their creation but going as far as to remember the order in which she made each one despite them appearing all to be relatively similar in appearance. As this dedication to magic has shown, she seems to be very skilled in her use of magic, especially divination magic or fortune telling.
Ibuki Shikimori (å¼�å®ˆ ä¼Šå�¹, Shikimori Ibuki ? )
Voiced by: Miru (PC), Oma Ichimura (PS2/anime)
Ibuki is a young girl and powerful mage who transfers into Sumomo's class. Most of the time, she is very standoffish and will push people away from her either figuratively or literally, so as to be left alone. Her family is known for being well-advanced in terms of magic, and even at such a young age Ibuki has shown herself to be well skilled as she uses her magic wand named Bisaim (ãƒ“ã‚µã‚¤ãƒ , Bisaimu ? ), which takes the form of an umbrella. The KamijÅ� family has been serving the Shikimori family for generations. This explains why Saya and Shinya KamijÅ� are always with Ibuki and act as her protectors and followers. She wanted to retrieve the Shikimori treasure for a reason that she wanted to see her sister, Natsumi, who died from sealing the angel demons that came out of the treasure. She mistakenly thought that Haruhi, because of her great skills in using magic, is the daughter of the woman who stole and hid the treasure.
Saya KamijÅ� (ä¸Šæ�¡ æ²™è€¶, KamijÅ� Saya ? )
Voiced by: Rina Misaki (PC), Shizuka ItÅ� (PS2/anime)
Saya is a young girl who transfers into YÅ«ma's class along with her twin brother Shinya, who is also a mage. She was initially mistaken for a ghost by Hachisuke after he met up with her one night by chance at school. Her magic wand is named Sanbach (ã‚µãƒ³ãƒ�ãƒƒãƒ�, Sanbahha ? ) and takes the form of a violin bow . They have been serving the Shikimori family for generations. They never knew their mother because she is already dead. The reason is unknown. Their, she and her brother Shinya, wanting to see and meet their mother, urged their father to steal the Shikimori treasure for it was believed to have powers that can bring back the spirit of the dead but it turned into chaos. The treasure was provoked and unleashed the angel demons contained in it. Thus, it must be sealed again. Suzura Minagi, Natsumi Shikimori and Takamine's mother tried to stop it. This however, ends up with Natsumi sacrificing her life to seal it and stop the demons, much to Ibuki's sorrow.

Voiced by: Oto Agumi (PC), Mai Goto (PS2/anime)
Sumomo is YÅ«ma's younger sister who seems to have an energetic personality. She has known Haruhi since childhood and they used to play together. Due to family circumstances, Sumomo didn't become YÅ«ma's sister until after she had entered elementary school. She has amazing skills in cooking.
Hachisuke Takamizo (é«˜æº� å…«è¼”, Takamizo Hachisuke ? )
Voiced by: Kikutaro Numekawa (PC), Takuo Kawamura (PS2/anime)
Hachisuke, otherwise known simply as Hachi, is one of YÅ«ma's close friends and hangs out with him and Jun Watarase constantly. He seems to be desperate for any affection from girls, as the closest chance he has at getting a girl is with his friend Jun, who, despite his feminine appearance, is in fact male. He is often very perverted as well.
Jun Watarase (æ¸¡è‰¯ç€¬ æº–, Watarase Jun ? )
Voiced by: FÅ«ri Samoto (PC), Michiru Yuimoto (PS2/anime)
Jun is another of YÅ«ma's close friends. Despite his feminine appearance, he is in fact an androgynous gay boy who crossdresses like a girl. He himself says he does this because the female school uniform suits him better and does make him popular among male students. Also, he has the desire to date YÅ«ma himself, but YÅ«ma being entirely heterosexual strongly refuses. He often says or does things that would be seen as ironic, such as saying how perverted men are, when he himself is male. Jun's signature attack, the Patriot Missile Kick, is a flying side kick , normally used as a means to keep Hachi under control.
Otoha Kohinata (å°�æ—¥å�‘ éŸ³ç¾½, Kohinata Otoha ? )
Voiced by: Tomomi Misaki (PC), Chizuko Hoshino (PS2/anime)
Otoha is the unorthodox mother of YÅ«ma and Sumomo. She runs the school cafeteria called Oasis. Otoha often does not act her age, but rather she acts closer to her daughter's age. She is close friends with Suzura Minagi. This is why Suzuri entrusts her to take care of Yuma.
