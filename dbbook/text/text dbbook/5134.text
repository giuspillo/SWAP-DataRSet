Plot
The body of a well-liked local historian is found half-buried under a drystone wall near the village of Helmthorpe, Swainsdale. Who on earth would want to kill such a thoughtful, dedicated man? Penny Cartwright, a beautiful folk singer with a mysterious past, a shady land-developer, Harryâ€™s editor and a local thriller writer are all suspectsâ€“and all are figures from Harryâ€™s previous, idyllic summers in the dale. A young girl, Sally Lumb, knows more than she lets on, and her knowledge could lead to danger. Inspector Banksâ€™s second case unearths disturbing secrets behind a bucolic facade.
