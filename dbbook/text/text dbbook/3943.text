Summary
The book is written from the point of view of author Tracy Kidder. It is set mainly in Haiti and Boston , Massachusetts . Kidder first met his subject, Dr. Paul Farmer, in Haiti in 1994. [1] At the time, Kidder was researching a story about American soldiers sent to reinstate Haiti's democratically elected government led by president Jean-Bertrand Aristide . [1] Kidder again met Farmer on his flight back to Miami , Florida from Haiti and began to learn small pieces of Farmer's life. [1] Farmer was born in Massachusetts and grew up as one of six children in a poor household in Florida, going on to attend Duke and Harvard , where he earned his M.D and Ph.D. [1] The rest of the book details Farmer's inspiring life and accomplishments, including Farmer's work with the health and social justice organization Partners in Health , especially in Haiti, Peru , and Russia . [1]
Kidder describes Paul Farmer as follows:
"And I was drawn to the man himself. He worked extraordinary hours. In fact, I donâ€™t think he sleeps more than an hour or two most nights. Here was a person who seemed to be practicing more than he preached, who seemed to be living, as nearly as any human being can, without hypocrisy. A challenging person, the kind of person whose example can irritate you by making you feel youâ€™ve never done anything as important, and yet, in his presence, those kinds of feelings tended to vanish. In the past, when Iâ€™d imagined a person with credentials like his, Iâ€™d imagined someone dour and self-righteous, but he was very friendly and irreverent, and quite funny. He seemed like someone Iâ€™d like to know, and I thought that if I did my job well, a reader would feel that way, too." [1]
The book is primarily a biographical work broken into five parts.
