Dracula Cha Cha Cha (re-titled Judgment of Tears in the US), is a 1998 novel by British writer Kim Newman. It is the third book in the Anno Dracula series.
Plot
In 1959, several of the world's notable vampires gather in Rome for the wedding of Count Dracula . Nefarious schemes are afoot and being investigated by British Intelligence, the Diogenes Club , and several others, including a British spy on the trail of a sinister madman with a white cat.
Setting
The book is an alternate history novel set in a world where Van Helsing never killed Dracula. The version of Rome shown in the book is heavily influenced by Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini . As always in the series, the novel contains a number of characters from other fictional works, though due to copyright restrictions some are not named or are given aliases.
Some of these identity shifts are quite clear (such as the character of Commander Hamish Bond, who has a fondness for martinis, drives an Aston Martin , carries a Walther PPK , has the Scots version of the name "James" for his name, and gets to say " the bitch is dead ."), while some are more obscure (a Kansas football player named Kent, for example).
The novel's original title is inspired by Bruno Martino 's song Dracula Cha Cha Cha, which appears on the album Italian Graffiti (1960/61?) and is performed onscreen in Vincente Minnelli 's film Two Weeks in Another Town (1962).
Characters from other works of fiction
These characters come from a variety of different sources. Some, mostly those from public domain works, are listed by name. Some of the others are listed by mere descriptions.
