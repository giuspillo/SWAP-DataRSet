Muna has never seen his father and only knows that he is a chrysanthemum tattoo on his shoulder. He meets a likable ronin named Takanobu on a ship, which Muna was hiding on. Later on, after Muna and Takanobu have left the ship, they are in the city and go exploring. Muna loses track of where Takanobu goes, and eventually gets lost. Finally, Muna finds Takanobu asleep next to a fence. As Takanobu takes care of Muna, he finds him a job cleaning stables. But one New Year's Eve a fire occurs at the Red Dog where Takanobu met Muna and sent him to do an errand. On the errand, someone tells him that a man named "Plum Face", who person Muna knew is dead. He is also told that Takanobu is "dead". Muna faints from the noxious fumes of the fire and is badly burnt, unable to wake up. Later, a man named Fukuji, who is the master swordsmith of the capital, finds Muna. Muna stays with Fukuji, doing house chores and other "women's work". One day when Muna was outside, he saw a man dressed as a monk who seemed to be following exactly what he did. When Muna pulls a trick on the man, he finds out that he is Takanobu. Takanobu is happy to see Muna again, and asks him to do one favor. Takanobu wants Muna to steal a sword from Fukuji and give it to him. He convinces Muna to give him the sword by saying that he is Muna's father. But when Muna brings the sword to Takanobu, he says he would not give it to Takanobu unless he said he was Muna's father. When Takanobu did not answer, Muna attacked. Muna runs away to the woods, and eventually buries the sword in front of a neglected shrine. At the same time, Fukuji, who has woken up, wonders where Muna has gone. Suddenly, a visitor comes to Fukuji and tells him that he is Muna's father. Fukuji realizes that the visitor is Takanobu. When Takanobu who never died claims that he is Muna's father, Muna must choose between fulfilling his "father's" wishes and proving his loyalty to Fukujii.
