Of Grammatology (French: De la grammatologie) is a 1967 book by French philosopher Jacques Derrida that has been called a foundational text for deconstructive criticism. It is one of three books, the others being Speech and Phenomena (French: La voix et le phénomène) and Writing and Difference (French: L'écriture et la différence), that Derrida published in 1967 and which established his reputation. It discusses writers such as Claude Lévi-Strauss, Ferdinand de Saussure, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Étienne Condillac, Louis Hjelmslev, Edmund Husserl, Roman Jakobson, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, André Leroi-Gourhan, and William Warburton. The English translation by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak was first published in 1976. A revised edition of the translation was published in 1997.
Contents
Derrida argues that throughout the Western philosophical tradition, writing has been considered as merely a derivative form of speech, and thus as a "fall" from the "full presence" of speech. In the course of the work he deconstructs this position as it appears in the work of several writers, showing the myriad aporias and ellipses to which this leads them. Derrida does not claim to be giving a critique of the work of these thinkers, because he does not believe it possible to escape from operating with such oppositions. Nevertheless, he calls for a new science of " grammatology " that would relate to such questions in a new way. [1]
Of Grammatology introduced many of the concepts which Derrida would employ in later work, especially in relation to linguistics and writing . [2]
Saussure and structuralism
The book starts with a review of Saussure's linguistic structuralism , as presented in the Course in General Linguistics . In particular, Derrida analyzes the concept of " sign ", which for Saussure has the two separate components of sound and meaning. These components are also called signifier (signifiant) and signified (signifiÃ©). [3]
Derrida quotes Saussure: â€œLanguage and writing are two distinct systems of signs; the second exists for the sole purpose of representing the first.â€� [4]
Critiquing this relationship between speech and writing, Derrida suggests that written symbols are legitimate signifiers on their ownâ€”that they should not be considered as secondary or derivative relative to oral speech. [5]
Influence

It has been called a foundational text for deconstructive criticism. [6]
