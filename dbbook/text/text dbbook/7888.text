Attempted film adaption
In 1966, Paramount Pictures attempted to make it a film starring Burt Lancaster as Lee Mellon and Steve McQueen as the drifter. The film adaption by Paramount Pictures never happened. However, Brautigan gave a copy of his novel to Brandon French of Brady French Films to write a screenplay for the movie. The screenplay was only written up to the first draft and the film adaptation never happened.
