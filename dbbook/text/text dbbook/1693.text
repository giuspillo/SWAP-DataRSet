The Good Husband of Zebra Drive is the eighth in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series of novels by Alexander McCall Smith, set in Gaborone, Botswana, and featuring the Motswana protagonist Precious Ramotswe.
Plot summary
As winter turns to spring across the red earth, all is not quite as it should be on Zebra Drive. There are the usual number of cases to be pursued, from persistent theft at Teenie Magama's printing works to the case of three suspicious deaths at the Mochudi hospital, but there is also discontent among the ranks.
Charlie is off on another escapade and Mma Makutsi's impending marriage threatens her happy working relationship with Mma Ramotswe. And when Mr J.L.B. Matekoni decides to try a little detective work, disaster looms.
One of the threads in this story that deals with a hospital in Mma Ramotswe's home town of Mochudi is the same as a plot line in an Inspector Frost mystery â€“ the season 8 story "Benefit of the Doubt".
