The Judge and His Hangman (German: Der Richter und sein Henker) is a 1950 novel by the Swiss writer Friedrich Dürrenmatt. It was first published in English in 1954, in a translation by Cyrus Brooks and later in a translation by Therese Pol. A new translation by Joel Agee appeared in 2006, published together with it sequel Suspicion, as The Inspector Bärlach Mysteries, with a foreword by Sven Birkerts. Together with Dürrenmatt's The Pledge: Requiem for the Detective Novel, these stories are considered classics of crime fiction, fusing existential philosophy and the detective genre.
Plot
Commissar BÃ¤rlach of the Bernese police, who is dying of cancer, must solve the murder of his best officer, Lieutenant Ulrich Schmied. BÃ¤rlach is assisted in his investigation by officer Walter Tschanz. As Schmied had been investigating the crimes of Richard Gastmann, a career master criminal who is an old friend and enemy of BÃ¤rlach, suspicion immediately falls upon Gastmann. But BÃ¤rlach's and Tschanz's "investigation" of Gastmann yields an unexpected twist after Tschanz kills Gastmann, supposedly in self-defense. BÃ¤rlach then reveals that he has known all along that Tschanz is the one who murdered Schmied.
Tschanz had purposefully killed Gastmann so that Gastmann would be forever blamed for Schmied's murder. Furthermore, BÃ¤rlach had manipulated Tschanz into this action with the manner in which BÃ¤rlach had pressed forward with their seeming investigation of Gastmann. BÃ¤rlach had deliberately pushed Tschanz toward a final, fatal confrontation with Gastmann, resulting in Gastmann's death: the punishment BÃ¤rlach considers just for all of the previous crimes Gastmann had committed, but which BÃ¤rlach had been unable to prove.
In fact, Gastmann and BÃ¤rlach went back forty years. They had long ago made a personal bet with one another as to whether it was possible to commit the "perfect" crime, such that even an investigator who personally witnessed it would never be able to prove the perpetrator guilty. After that bet, Gastmann, as BÃ¤rlach well knew, had pursued a lifelong career as a purveyor of crime, evil in its comprehensiveness, arrogant and mocking of civilisation itself. And indeed, he always remained one step ahead of BÃ¤rlach's tireless but fruitless efforts to convict him. Gastmann recalled to BÃ¤rlach: "I wanted to prove that it was possible to commit a crime that couldn't be solved." Gastmann had been correct, and BÃ¤rlach's final plot is an acknowledgment thereof. By murdering Schmied during Schmied's investigation of Gastmann, Tschanz had ruined the terminally ill BÃ¤rlach's final chance to bring Gastmann to justice in a courtroom. Therefore, using Tschanz as a pawn, BÃ¤rlach finds an alternate method to mete out the justice for which he feels Gastmann is overdue.

(February 2012)
The central question of this book is whether or not it is right to frame a person for a crime they didn't commit, if they've committed another crime that was never proven. BÃ¤rlach affirms the question when he says to Gastmann: "I couldn't prove that it was you who committed the first crime, but I am transferring this crime to you" â€” therefore, Gastmann, the very embodiment of evil criminality, was finally punished.
The interplay between BÃ¤rlach and Lutz takes on a symbolic dimension. Lutz, the university educated overseer, insists on the efficacy of modern, scientific crime-solving methods "from the Chicago school", which is based mainly on circumstantial evidence and forensics . BÃ¤rlach is skeptical, relying instead on his deep knowledge of human motives, born of lifelong experience. Tschanz, BÃ¤rlach's underling, makes use of the modern evidence-to-proof method and serves as a contrast to BÃ¤rlach's style of natural intuition and usage of human manipulation. While Tschanz's methods make ostensible progress on the case, ultimately, it is BÃ¤rlach's intuitive sense that has long since enabled him to determine the truth, and also enables him to use Tschanz to settle his old score with Gastmann.
One can understand the novel also as question: "When humans determine themselves the fate of others they become the judges, and when they become the instrument of others they become the henchmen." Having been set up by BÃ¤rlach to kill Gastmann, Tschanz says to BÃ¤rlach at the end of the story, "Then you were the judge and I the hangman". Tschanz then kills himself the following day by stopping his car on an active railroad track.
