Plot summary
The main character, Al Bizarro, is a clone of a former LexCorp employee named Al Beezer. Created as a test for Dr. Happersen's cloning equipment which eventually created a Post-Crisis Bizarro , he was placed in suspended animation and forgotten.
When he is freed, he begins a search for his own identity, and his purpose in life, which eventually takes him to Apokolips (where he befriends a Female Fury named Seera), and later to South America .
In a parody of the original Bizarro code, Al Beezer tells Al Bizarro that, if he wants to be happy, he should do "the exact opposite" of everything the original Al did.
