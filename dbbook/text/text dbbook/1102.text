The Art of Fiction: A Guide for Writers and Readers is a nonfiction book by Ayn Rand, published posthumously. Edited by Tore Boeckmann, it was published by Plume in 2000. The book is based on a 1958 series of 12 four-hour lectures about fiction which Rand gave to a group of student readers and writers in her living room. A companion book is The Art of Nonfiction.
Background
In 1958, Rand delivered a series private lectures about writing fiction. A successful novelist, playwright and screenwriter, Rand had released her last novel, Atlas Shrugged , the previous year. Rand's heir (and lecture attendee) Leonard Peikoff says in his introduction for the book that she "was at the peak of her powers as a novelist". [1] The lectures were informal, delivered in the living room of her New York apartment to around a dozen people, by invitation only. These included personal friends and students from the Nathaniel Branden Lectures , a lecture series developed by Rand's protege Nathaniel Branden . Rand led 12 four-hour sessions over six months. [2] The sessions were recorded and later made available for purchase. Boeckmann edited the book out of transcripts of those recordings and related materials, including a follow-up lecture Rand gave in 1959 and comments from a 1969 lecture series she did about non-fiction writing.

There is a chapter on characterization and three chapters on style . The final chapter is titled "Special Forms of Literature" and discusses such matters as humor , fantasy and tragedy .
Reception
Literature professor Stephen D. Cox reviewed the book for The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies . He says the book provides valuable insights into Rand's literary views and techniques, which go beyond what was included in her earlier book The Romantic Manifesto . [5] However, he describes some of her claims as exaggerated, [6] and says some of her ideas are "provocative but insufficiently developed". [7]
In her biography of Rand, Goddess of the Market , historian Jennifer Burns mentions The Art of Fiction as one of several books that "are derived from archival materials but have been significantly rewritten." [8] Cox also expresses concerns about how the material was edited, saying that the nature and extent of the changes is not made clear enough in the finished text. [9]
