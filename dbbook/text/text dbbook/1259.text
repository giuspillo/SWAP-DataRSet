(July 2011)
Detective Hercule Poirot and Captain Arthur Hastings are holidaying when they meet Magdala "Nick" Buckley, who casually mentions that she has escaped certain death at least thrice. Poirot suspects that somebody is out to get her, and his suspicions prove true. He finds many shady characters who may have some reason to kill the girl. Despite Poirot's best efforts, a murder does occur, but not of the intended victim. When the motive itself is unclear, why did the murder take place?
Plot Summary
Poirot and Hastings are staying at the Majestic Hotel in a Cornish resort. A conversation with Nick Buckley leads Poirot to believe that someone is out to kill her. This is confirmed when Poirot finds a bullet that Nick had thought to be a wasp shooting past her head. Poirot explains his concern to Nick, who does not believe him until the bullet is revealed to be from Nick's own gun, which has gone missing. Poirot suspects someone in Nick's inner circle, and starts shortlisting various suspects.
Nick's nearest living relative is a lawyer cousin, Charles Vyse, who arranged the re-mortgaging on End House for her to supply desperately needed funds. Her housekeeper is named Ellen, and the lodge near End House is leased by Mr and Mrs Croft, an Australian couple. Then there is George Challenger, who has soft spot for Nick. Nick's two closest friends are Freddie Rice, an abused wife, and Jim Lazarus, an art dealer in love with Freddie. It is revealed that Nick was to undergo appendix surgery six months before, in consequence of which the Crofts suggested she make a will.
Poirot doesn't understand why somebody would want Nick dead: Charles would inherit End House and Freddie would get rest of the estate â€“ none of which is worth killing for. Poirot advises Nick to call some relative to stay with her for a few weeks. Nick decides to call her distant cousin Maggie. The day Maggie arrives, Nick hosts a little party at which everyone except George is present. Meanwhile, a renowned pilot named Michael Seton has gone missing, which sparks a debate about his fate. Nick receives a call while rest of the guests are enjoying the party. Later, Maggie is found dead, wearing Nick's shawl. Nick and Maggie had gone to freshen up, after which Maggie took Nick's shawl. George, who has finally arrived at End House, is relieved to see Nick alive. Realizing that Maggie was killed by mistake under his own nose, Poirot becomes furious and launches an investigation. He finds that Ellen was working instead of enjoying the festivities, but she claims she knows nothing. However, Ellen tells him that there is a secret compartment somewhere in the house, which Nick denies.
To protect Nick, Poirot tells everybody that she is being sent to a hospital as she has taken the events very badly. He tells everyone to leave her alone and asks her to not eat anything that comes from an unknown place. The next day, Poirot learns through the newspapers that Michael Seton is dead and correctly deduces that Nick received this information through the call. Nick confesses to Poirot that she and Michael were secretly engaged. Since Michael was the sole inheritor of vast wealth, it now becomes clear that all his wealth will go to Nick.
Poirot suspects Freddie of trying to kill Nick to gain the money. On other hand, he also thinks that Charles may have tried to kill her, not knowing anything about the will or its contents. Additionally, Poirot is wary of the Crofts: he tells Inspector Japp to make enquiries about them. Meanwhile, Poirot and Hastings find the love letters written by Michael, but Nick's original will is not found. Nick remembers that she had already sent it to Charles. Poirot questions Charles, who denies getting any will. On the other hand, Mr Croft tells Poirot that he sent the will to Charles, leading Poirot to believe that one of the men is lying.
Later, after meeting Michael's attorney, Poirot confirms that Nick was indeed going to receive the money. Another attempt on Nick's life takes place when she eats a chocolate from a box, allegedly sent by Poirot himself. The chocolates are found to be laced with cocaine, but Nick is safe as she ate only one. The chocolates were actually supplied by Freddie, who claims that Nick phoned her to bring the chocolates. Freddie notes that she found Nick's voice a bit different. Poirot suspects Freddie, as he realises that she is a cocaine addict and hence has access to its supply. Later, a note demanding money is found, but neither the recipient's nor the sender's identity is known. Poirot finds some love letters written to Michael. He lies to everybody saying that Nick is dead, and convinces her to play dead.
Some days later, Charles tells Poirot that he has received Nick's will. The will is read in End House, according to which all her money goes to the Crofts, whom she claims had helped her father in Australia. Everyone is in disbelief, except the Crofts themselves, but Nick's "ghost" appears and it is revealed that the Crofts forged the will and sent it to Charles. Japp reveals that the Crofts are forgers. When they "learned" Nick was dead, they sent a fraudulent will to Charles. He arrests the duo, but Poirot claims that they had no hand in the murder. Just then, somebody shoots at Freddie and misses. Poirot captures the man, who is revealed to be Freddie's sick and dying husband.
Now, Poirot gives the denouement saying that there is indeed a secret panel in the mansion. He reveals that the real murderer is Nick herself and that Michael was actually engaged to Maggie, not Nick. Both had the same name, Magdala, but the correspondence had taken place between Michael and "Maggie". After learning of Michael's wealth and disappearance, Nick plotted to present herself as Michael's love interest to usurp his wealth. The whole setup was her own work, to engineer a reason for bringing Maggie there and killing her, preventing anybody from knowing the truth.
Next, it is revealed that George was the one who used to supply cocaine to both Freddie and Nick. Nick used her supply to poison the chocolates. The note about money was from Freddie's husband, who was constantly asking her for money. Nick is arrested, upon which she takes Freddie's cocaine box as a souvenir. Poirot tells George to either surrender himself or go away, leaving Freddie (who had stopped taking the drugs) to presumably recover from her addiction. He notes that the box taken by Nick contains a lethal dose of cocaine, which she will use to escape the gallows. In the end, Jim and Freddie decide to get married.
Literary significance and reception
The Times Literary Supplement on 14 April 1932, stated that the "actual solution is quite unusually ingenious, and well up to the standard of Mrs. Christie's best stories. Everything is perfectly fair, and it is possible to guess the solution of the puzzle fairly early in the book, though it is certainly not easy." The review further opined that, "This is certainly one of those detective stories which is pure puzzle, without any ornament or irrelevant interest in character. Poirot and his faithful Captain Hastings are characters whom one is glad to meet again, and they are the most lively in the book, but even they are little more than pawns in this problem. But the plot is arranged with almost mathematical neatness, and that is all that one wants." [3]
Isaac Anderson began his review in The New York Times Book Review on 6 March 1932, by writing "With Agatha Christie as the author and Hercule Poirot as the central figure, one is always assured of an entertaining story with a real mystery to it ... [T]he person who is responsible for the dirty work at End House is diabolically clever, but not quite clever enough to fool the little Belgian detective all the time. A good story with a most surprising finish." [4]
Robert Barnard : "A cunning use of simple tricks used over and over in Christie's career (be careful, for example, about names â€“ diminutives and ambiguous male-female Christian names are always possibilities as readers discover). Some creaking in the machinery, and rather a lot of melodrama and improbabilities, prevent this from being one of the very best of the classic specimens." [5]
References or allusions
References to other works
Two references (in chapters 1 and 5) are made to the events told in The Mystery of the Blue Train and it is clearly stated in chapter 1 that Peril at End House takes place the August following Poirot's trip to the French Riviera described in that book.
At the beginning of chapter 14, Hastings describes how Poirot's obsession for tidiness helped him solve a case when he straightened ornaments on a mantelpiece. This is an indirect reference to The Mysterious Affair at Styles .
In chapter 15, Poirot mentions the case The Chocolate Box included in the book Poirot's Early Cases , when he tells Commander Challenger that he indeed had failures in the past.
In chapter 16, Inspector Japp asks Poirot if he had not retired to grow marrows. This is an indirect reference to the failed attempt at retirement depicted in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd , when Poirot settled in the small village of King's Abbot, only to be prompted to investigate a murder in the village.
References to actual history, geography and current science
Transposed from Devon to Cornwall, the Majestic Hotel of the book is based on the Imperial Hotel in Torquay . [6]
In chapter seven, reference is made by the characters to a female aviator who went to Australia. This is an allusion to Amy Johnson who made the first solo flight from England to Australia by a woman from 5 May 1930 to 24 May 1930.
Film, TV or theatrical adaptations
1940 stage play
The story was adapted into a play by Arnold Ridley in 1940 and opened in the West End of London at the Vaudeville Theatre on 1 May. Poirot was played by Francis L. Sullivan .
Agatha Christie's Poirot
An obscure Russian film version, entitled Zagadka Endkhauza, was made in 1989.
The novel was also adapted for the small screen and made into a TV drama in 1990, as part of the Agatha Christie's Poirot second series. Poirot was portrayed by David Suchet and Nick Buckley by Polly Walker . Overall, the film was quite faithful to the novel; however, Freddie's husband does not appear in the film, no shot is fired during the denoument , Challenger is arrested rather than being allowed to flee, and the fates of Freddie and Jim remain unresolved.
This episode was filmed in Salcombe , Devon (near Agatha Christie's hometown of Torquay ), rather than on the actual Cornish Coast where the story is set. As the director of the TV series, Renny Rye explained: "Salcombe actually had more Thirties elements about it than we could find on the Cornish Coast â€“ which was our main criterion. A little deception is an essential thing in television, I believe, and as Agatha Christie didn't set her story in any specific Cornish town I hope we didn't upset anyone too much!" [7]
PC adaptation
On 22 November 2007, Peril at End House, like Death on the Nile , was adapted into a PC game by Flood Light Games, and published as a joint venture between Oberon Games and Big Fish Games , with the player once again taking the role of Poirot as he searches End House and other areas in Cornwall Coast for clues, and questions suspects based on information he finds, this time through the clue cards he gains on the way. [8]
Graphic novel adaptation
Peril at End House was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation in 2008, adapted by Thierry Jollet and illustrated by Didier Quella-Guyot ( ISBN 0-00-728055-6 ).

Book dedication
The dedication of the book reads:
To Eden Phillpotts . To whom I shall always be grateful for his friendship and the encouragement he gave me many years ago.
In 1908, Christie was recovering from influenza and bored, and she started to write a story at the suggestion of her mother, Clara Miller (see the dedication to The Mysterious Affair at Styles ). This suggestion sparked Christie's interest in writing and several pieces were composed, some of which are now lost or remain unpublished (one exception to this is The Call of Wings which later appeared in The Hound of Death in 1933). These early efforts were mostly short stories, but at some point late in the year Christie attempted her first novel, Snow Upon the Desert. She sent it to several publishers but they all rejected the work. At Clara's suggestion she then asked Phillpotts to read and critique both the book and other examples of her writing. He was a neighbour and friend of the Miller family in Torquay . He sent an undated reply back which included the praise that, "some of your work is capital. You have a great feeling for dialogue". In view of her later success in allowing readers to judge characters' feelings and motivations for themselves (and in doing so, thereby deceiving themselves as to the identity of the culprits), Phillpotts offered valuable suggestions to, "leave your characters alone, so that they can speak for themselves, instead of always rushing in to tell them what they ought to say, or to explain to the reader what they mean by what they are saying". He gave her further advice in the letter regarding a number of suggestions for further reading to help improve her work.
Phillpotts gave Christie an introduction to his own literary agents, Hughies Massie, who rejected her work (although in the early 1920s, they did start to represent her). Undaunted, Christie attempted another story, now lost, called Being So Very Wilful, and again asked Phillpotts for his views. He replied on 9 February 1909 with a great deal more advice and tips for reading. [10] In her autobiography , published posthumously in 1977, Christie wrote, "I can hardly express the gratitude I feel to him. He could so easily have uttered a few careless words of well-justified criticism and possibly discouraged me for life. As it was, he set out to help". [11]
Dustjacket blurb
The blurb on the inside flap of the dustjacket of the UK first edition (which is also repeated opposite the title page) reads:
Three near escapes from death in three days! Is it accident or design? And then a fourth mysterious incident happens, leaving no doubt that some sinister hand is striking at Miss Buckley, the charming young owner of the mysterious End House. The fourth attempt, unfortunately for the would-be murderer, is made in the garden of a Cornish Riviera hotel where Hercule Poirot, the famous Belgian detective, is staying. Poirot immediately investigates the case and relentlessly unravels a murder mystery that must rank as one of the most brilliant that Agatha Christie has yet written.
