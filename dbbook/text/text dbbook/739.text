Pogroms
Lingering
Each section is centered around a different theme. These themes include the ideas of personal identity, differences in physical appearance, differences in race, and the feelings toward the riot incidents. Smith divided Fires in the Mirror into themed sections and she systematically placed monologues into these themes. Each monologue has a heading of its own, and when placed into each section, gives an arc to Fires in the Mirror. It lays a path for the audience to follow the line from broad personal identity issues, to physical identity issues, to issues of race and ethnicity, and finally ending in issues relating to the Crown Heights incident.

Genre
Anna Deveare Smithâ€™s Fires in the Mirror is a unique kind of play. Since it is a collection of real peopleâ€™s thoughts and opinions, it is not a piece of work originating from Smithâ€™s thoughts, so there is not one singular author voice or point of view. However, there is an author concern and Smith makes it quite apparent.
Fires in the Mirror is a unique hybrid of genres, including aspects of melodrama, tragedy, and comedy, but it is not limited to only those genres. It is coined Docudrama . This is because it is a play about actual historical events. There is no personal commentary from Smith as the author and it is instead solely the words of the characters (real life people) involved in the events.
Style
The style of Fires in the Mirror is a unique, post-modern play. Fires in the Mirror is a collection of multiple voices and points of views. It is a hybrid of theater and journalism. Smith went out and interviewed all of the characters and recorded their words, their physical appearance, and their surroundings to give an accurate description of who these people were. Afterward, she arranged the words to fit into shorter monologues, while maintaining the essence of what they were trying to put forth in their words and emotions.
Smith is very detailed in how each interview was attained. She gives information as to where each one was done, including the settings and environment, other people that were near, and when the interviews took place. This adds emphasis to the fact that this play is very immediate and real. Nothing is fake or made up and everything is 100% real life.
The play is written out in verse. Smith tries to emulate through the use of lines, ellipses, and other notation, exactly how things were said in each interview. This adds emotion to plain text and when read, gives evidence into how things were actually said by each character during the interviews.
Fires in the Mirror is a post-modern play. According to David Rush, characteristics of a postmodern play include there being no â€œauthorâ€�, its purpose is to engage the audience rather than show, there may be multiple narratives interacting with each other, the structure departs from the conventional play pattern, and the play is usually fragmented. Fires in the Mirror encompasses all of these characteristics. [2]
Language
The use of language is that of words solely originating from individuals. Anna Deavere Smith interviewed individuals and recorded their words, exactly as said. Smith then transcribed their words onto paper. The culmination of Smithâ€™s work is a series of versed monologues that are able to convey both meaning and feeling. Smith tries to transcribe in a style that keeps all of the words and emotions of their authors intact. When read on paper, the words and sentences are broken up, to give a sense of sound of how they gave their interview. This portrays a sense that each character is in deep thought, excited and rushed, and so on during their interviews. This allowed Smith to emulate the characters' speech patterns and vocal rhythms to try to convey the essence of each character. [3]
Themes
Racially Motivated Anger
The central focus point of Fires in the Mirror is the anger between two races in the area of Crown Heights in New York City. The anger and tension is between the Lubaviticher Jewish community and the community of people of African American descent. Fires in the Mirror gives firsthand accounts of peoplesâ€™ thoughts on the events surrounding the crisis. During the times of murder and mayhem of the Crown Heights crisis, people were forced to make choices with limited options and it is apparent in the words of these people that much of the choices made were on the basis of race. Much of the words spoken have meaning deeply rooted in the historical background between the Jews and the blacks. The information given in each monologue makes references to slavery and the holocaust, the relationships between the two races and the police, as well as the perceptions of the relationships between each other. It is made apparent that there is much anger between the two races and Smithâ€™s play allows a voice for each character to express their viewpoint. They are allowed to express anger and feelings freely and the audience is given many personal accounts.
Personal Identity
Fires in the Mirror is the personal account of real life people involved in the Crown Heights crisis. They give personal testimony to Smith via interview and in the end, Smith has come up with a collection of multiple perspectives on the crisis, the events surrounding, and the deep clash between the two races. By showing us many different points of view and opinions on the issue, we are shown that everyoneâ€™s idea on the issue is a little bit different. There are not just two sides to the issue, divided by race; rather, there are many different attitudes, emotions, and opinions that are uniquely individual.
Spectacle
The main element of Fires in the Mirror that is of utmost importance to the spectacle of the play, is the fact that Fires in the Mirror is originally staged as a one-person play. A single actor plays every single part. Smith staged her play with no real physical set and limited props and costumes. At the world premiere of Fires in the Mirror, Smith performs as a solo actor on stage. Real black and white photographs are displayed behind her as she moves from one monologue and character to the next.3 She moves from one character to the next by slightly changing her appearance. In most of her performance she is dressed in black pants and white shirt and is barefoot. [4]
Music
The music for Fires in the Mirror varies significantly. Smith overlays music and her monologues. Her music choices range from black hip hop to Jewish chants. She chooses her music to pair well with the authorâ€™s background or the essence of each monologue. [5]
