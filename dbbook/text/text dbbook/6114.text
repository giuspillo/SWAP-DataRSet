The Klingon Dictionary is a book by Marc Okrand describing the Klingon language. First published in 1985 and then again with an addendum in 1992, it includes pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary. It has been an international bestseller, selling more than a half-million copies. The book is a mere description of the grammar with few examples for every rule. It is not suitable for active learning and practice of the language, because it does not contain any exercices. It has never been intended as a learning book. Its source was intended as a guide for scriptwriters and actors. It was only later sold for merchandising for Star Trek fans.
Summary
The dictionary is written from an in universe perspective. After a brief introduction about the Klingon culture and also how the book has been written, the pronunciation of the Klingon letters is described. Instead of using phonetic symbols, the letters of the Latin alphabet are used, some of them written in upper case to distinguish special pronunciations (for instance q and Q). The largest part of the book is a description of the grammar, including briefly described rules sorted by type of words, accompanied by few examples for each grammatical topic. The last part of the book contains a list of vocabulary with roughly 1,500 words, followed by a list of useful phrases. The addendum of 1992 contains some new grammatical details and a list of about 200 new words that appeared in or were created for later movies and in the TV show Star Trek: The Next Generation .
