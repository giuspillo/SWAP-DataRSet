Caddie Woodlawn is a children's historical fiction novel by Carol Ryrie Brink which received the Newbery Medal in 1936 and a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958. The original edition was illustrated by Newbery-award winning author and illustrator Kate Seredy. Macmillan released a later edition in 1973, illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman.
Plot
Set in the 1860s, Caddie Woodlawn is about a lively eleven-year-old tomboy named Caroline Augusta Woodlawn, nicknamed "Caddie", living in the area of Dunnville, Wisconsin . As a young girl Caddie made the journey from Boston to Wisconsin with her family, a journey which nearly cost her life. Sickly and weak, Caddie is allowed to run wild with her brothers Tom and Warren to regain her health. The three young Woodlawns spend much of their time exploring the woods and rivers that surround their farm. The book opens with Caddie, late for dinner after an excursion to visit the local Native American tribe, embarrassing her mother with her antics. Caddie, undaunted, spends the next year having a string of adventures and scares. From a midnight ride through the forest to warn her friend â€œIndian Johnâ€� that the settlers are planning a massacre, to a prairie fire that brings out the best in a school house bully, to a life-threatening fall through a lake while ice skating, Caddieâ€™s life is far from boring. Things come to a head when â€œperfectâ€� Cousin Annabelle from Boston arrives for a visit and Caddie is forced to confront her future. Tom and Warren, always a part of her adventures, come along for the journey into adulthood. This story is full of practical jokes and touching moments like the long journey home of a beloved pet. It is the true story of a familyâ€™s existence on the frontier during the Civil War, and offers insights into how life was lived in a small Wisconsin village where fear of local Native Americans was a reality and life and death situations arose with frightening regularity. The sequel to the book, Magical Melons (1939), continues the story of Caddie and her family.
Background
Brink was born and raised in Moscow, Idaho , in the Palouse region. [2] [3] Orphaned at age eight following her mother's suicide, Brink lived in Moscow with her widowed maternal grandmother and an unmarried aunt; [4] the grandmother had grown up on a farm in Wisconsin . [5] In a preface to the later edition of Caddie Woodlawn, the author said the books were partly based on the life of her grandmother, Caddie Woodhouse Watkins (1853â€“1940), [6] and her siblings: elder sister Clara, elder brother Tom, younger brother Warren, younger sisters Henrietta and Minnie, and Baby Joe. [7]
The house where her grandmother had lived is now a historical site, about 12 miles (19 km) south of Menomonie, Wisconsin . [1]
Critical reception
Children's literature expert May Hill Arbuthnot says of Caddie Woodlawn, "this book is far less of a frontier storyâ€”settlers versus Indiansâ€”than it is the entertaining evolution of a tomboy. The fun Caddie gets out of life suggests the usefulness of this book in counteracting the overseriousness of most historical fiction." [8] Kirkus Reviews said it provides "an authentic picture of life on a frontier farm when massacre was a real threat and when a livelihood, hardly earned, allowed for fun in natural outdoor things". [9] Caddie Woodlawn won the Newbery Medal in 1936. [10]
Adaptations
Brink transformed Caddie Woodlawn into a radio drama in 1945.
In 1989, a made-for-television movie based on the novel was directed by Giles Walker with teleplay by Joe Wisenfeld and Richard John Davis. Several changes were made from the book, most notably moving the conflict between the settlers and Indians toward the end, and greatly increasing the role of the character Annabelle, Caddie's cousin.
