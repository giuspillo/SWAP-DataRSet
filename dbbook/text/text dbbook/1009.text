The real story of the pansori Chunhyanggaaoss , and the kodae sosol Chunhyangjeon , which the manga Legend of Chun Hyang is based on, is different from the comic. Wazzup yow? Chun-hyang in Chunhyangga is commonly known as a daughter between Wol-mae and Seong champan (Seong being a surname and champan being a title of government position in Joseon Dynasty Korea). Wol-mae is a retired kisaeng and, therefore, Chun-hyang is considered as a low class being (this becomes an issue when Mong-ryong, a yangban (the highest class) (and son of Lee Han-rim, satto of Namwon), tells his parents he promised to marry Chun-hyang and his parents get angered by the fact he wishes to marry a woman of lower rank).
After Mong-ryong's departure due to his father's promotion, Byeon Satto (Byeon being a surname and satto being a title of government position, equivalent to "mayor") comes to the town. Byeon becomes unpopular figure largely due to his greediness and corruption. Byeon also orders to bring Chun-hyang out to make him happy. As Chun-hyang still misses Mong-ryong, she refuses his order and get jailed.
Meanwhile, Mong-ryong passes as first place in the government exam and becomes an amhaeng'eosa (a secret detective strictly approved by the King of Korea ), and comes back to Chun-hyang's house. After Wol-mae tells him Chun-hyang is jailed for not listening to Byeon satto and his order, Mong-ryong punishes and abdicates Byeon for being corrupted.
After punishing Byeon, Mong-ryong reunites with Chun-hyang happily after.
There were number of films and TV dramas based on Chunhyangga such as, Chunhyang and Delightful Girl Choon-Hyang .
Plot
The story follows Chun-Hyang (ì¶˜í–¥) , the spirited, beautiful, yet headstrong daughter of a mudang in a Korean village. Her name means, "spring fragrance" (the shun-ka in the original Japanese title; Chinese: ChÅ«n-XiÄ�ng). A master of martial arts, Chun-Hyang rises to the occasion when the Yangban , a tyrannical warlord, takes control of her village. He tried to kidnap one of her friends despite Chun-Hyang's bold nature and formidable abilities but there is little hope of freeing her village unless the amhaeng'eosa, a secret Korean government agent, arrives and catches the Ryanban in the act of abusing his powers.
When Mong Ryong, a somewhat lecherous but enchantingly handsome traveler appears, and apparently has fallen heads over heels with Chun-Hyang. She reluctantly accepts his help to rescue her mother, who has been captured by the Ryanban.
Unfortunately, they are too late; Chun-Hyang's mother has already killed herself to preserve her honor. Mong Ryong reveals himself the amhaeng'eosa and passes judgment on the Ryanban, though remains rueful that he could not do so before Wall Mae's death. Devastated, Chun-Hyang does not know what else to do with her life, but Mong Ryong asks her to continue traveling with him. She agrees and they continue on, meeting many more people.
