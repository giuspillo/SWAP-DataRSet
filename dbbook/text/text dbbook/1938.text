Foundation's Triumph
Foundation and Chaos (1998) is a science fiction novel by Greg Bear , set in Isaac Asimov 's Foundation universe. It is the second book of the Second Foundation trilogy, which was written after Asimov's death by three authors, authorized by the Asimov estate.
Plot summary
The novel is the second part of The Second Foundation Trilogy and takes place almost entirely in the same time frame as " The Psychohistorians ," which is the first part of the novel Foundation . In addition to telling a more expanded version of Hari Seldon 's confrontation with the Commission of Public Safety it also interweaves R. Daneel Olivaw 's struggle against a sect of robots who oppose his plans for humanity.
While covering the same period as in Asimovâ€™s â€œ The Psychohistorians ,â€� Foundation and Chaos focuses more on paternal superrobot R Daneel Olivaw than on Hari Seldon. Olivawâ€™s 20 millennia of machinations and contrivances are questioned by â€œCalvinianâ€� robots who do not observe Olivawâ€™s Zeroth Law (â€œNo robot may harm humanity or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harmâ€�) developed in Asimovâ€™s Robots and Empire. Olivawâ€™s actions dampen human intellectual growth and variation until the human species matures. The novelâ€™s primary issue is whether Olivawâ€™s ends justify his means.[ original research? ] Does the ancient Auroran robot really serve humanityâ€™s greater good? Should Olivaw decide this for himself?
Seldon seems unaware of Olivawâ€™s role in perpetuating brain fever and other dampeners. But Seldon would probably approve,[ original research? ] considering his quarantining of the New Renaissance worlds when Seldon served as Imperial 1st Minister.
Foundation and Chaos portrays the rise of mentallics (telepaths who can influence otherâ€™s thoughts) such as Wanda Seldon and Stettin Palver, who will form the Second Foundation. Twisted rogue mentallic Vara Liso even foreshadows the mutant Magnificoâ€™s spectacular rise 310 years later. Powerful Public Safety Commissioner Linge Chen again plays a prominent role as the true Imperial power behind fatuous playboy Emperor Klayus. Reconstructed superrobot Dors Venabili reappears as well.
