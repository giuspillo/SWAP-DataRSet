Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools is a computer science textbook by Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D. Ullman about compiler construction. Although more than two decades have passed since the publication of the first edition, it is widely regarded as the classic definitive compiler technology text. It is affectionately known as the Dragon Book to a generation of computer scientists as its cover depicts a knight and a dragon in battle, a metaphor for conquering complexity. This name can also refer to Aho and Ullman's older Principles of Compiler Design.
