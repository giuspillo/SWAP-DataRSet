Synopsis
Thirteen-year-old Kit and his family have moved back to Stoneygate to be with his grandfather, who is succumbing to Alzheimerâ€™s Disease , after Kit's Grandmother dies. His grandfather, an ex-miner, tells him about the town's coal-mining days and the hardships and disasters that were a part of his youth. Kit meets Allie Keenan, full of energy and life, but also shadowy John Askew and the dangerous 'game' he plays â€“ a game called Death. Through playing the game, Kit comes to see the lost children of the mines and begins to connect his grandfatherâ€™s fading memories to his, his friendsâ€™ and Stoneygateâ€™s history. [4]
The Watsons are known as one of the â€œOld familiesâ€� [5] because they have ancestors who worked in the mines before they were closed, such as Kitâ€™s grandfather. Askew surrounds himself with characters that are from families who worked in the mines including Kit. Now that he is a part of Askewâ€™s group, Kit is invited to play the game Death, in which they reenact the death of children in the mines.
Once chosen for Death, Kit undergoes a change; snapping at Allie on multiple occasions. Noting this change, his teacher Miss Bush follows him and uncovers the game. Askew is expelled from school for being the leader, and to escape his father, who is an alcoholic, runs away and lives in an abandoned mine shafts. Angry at Kit for ending the game and getting him expelled, Askew sends Bobby Carr, another character from the â€œOld familiesâ€� [5] group, to bring Kit to the cave where they confront each other in the bookâ€™s climax.
After some initial arguments reveal Askewâ€™s madness, Kit tells Askew a story he â€œwrote for you[Askew].â€� [6] The story mirrors Askewâ€™s life from the perspective of an early man named Lak, and while telling it they see ghosts from the story. When the tale concludes, the ghost takes a â€œpart of me[Askew]â€� [7] and he is no longer mad. Allie finds the two of them in the mine after getting their location from Bobby, and they go back to town. Askew is accepted back into school to take art classes, his father stops drinking, and at the end of the novel, Kitâ€™s grandfather dies.

Background
Many of the elements from the story were taken from the authorâ€™s own life. In an interview he talked about how, in the town he grew up in, â€œWe had a monument...[and]an old graveyard...to a pit disasterâ€� [12] just like in the novel. He also based the game death on â€œchildrenâ€™s games I played.â€� [12] In addition he â€œbased the book on his own childhood in a northeast England mining community.â€� [13]
Major themes and style
Kitâ€™s Wilderness included conflicting opposites and important relationships. The Horn Book Magazine noted some themes, including â€œLight and dark, of life and death, [and] of remembering and forgetting.â€� [9] An interview with the â€œpower of friendship.â€� [12] He went on to note the, â€œbravery of children.â€� [12] and how it had played a central role in his writing.
Kitâ€™s Wilderness uses style as both a literary element and to add another layer to the story. Enicia Fisher noted the â€œrare break from story-telling tradition,[in which] David Almond gives the ending away at the beginning." [13] She also made a point of the â€œWeb of storiesâ€� [13] in the book that resulted from Kitâ€™s story within the story. Enicia Fisher also described the story as a blend of â€œMagic and realism." [13]
Reception
Kitâ€™s Wilderness received both positive and negative reviews, being praised and criticized by critics. A review in the Forecasts newspaper praised the novel as â€œAwe inspiring.â€� [14] Enicia Fisher described the internal storytelling as an â€œImagistic tale," [13] though it has been said that reading this book required a â€œSuspension of disbelief.â€� [14] The book was also called â€œConvoluted" [9] by the Horn Book Magazine. And yet, the School Library Journal praised Kitâ€™s Wilderness for its â€œOtherworldliness.â€� [15]
