Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood is a novel written by Rebecca Wells. It follows the novel Little Altars Everywhere. In 2005, Wells wrote Ya-Yas in Bloom and then The Crowning Glory of Calla Lily Ponder. Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood tells the story of the downward spiraling mother-daughter relationship of Vivian Walker and Siddalee Walker.
Plot summary
When Vivi, Teensy, Necie, and Caro were younger, they created the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. The Ya-Yaâ€™s caused shenanigans and chaos everywhere, but also had a sisterly bond that could fix anything. Now, at 70 years old, the Ya-Yaâ€™s are determined to fix the struggling relationship between mother and daughter.
Siddalee â€œSiddaâ€� Walker, a play director, has never had a smooth relationship with her mother, Vivi, but when a New York Times reporter twists Siddaleeâ€™s words around in an article about her recent play, Siddalee and Viviâ€™s mother-daughter relationship goes spiraling down. Not only is Sidda having trouble with her mother, but she is also having trouble with her fiancÃ©, Conner. Sidda postpones the wedding between her and Conner. Between that and Siddaâ€™s now fear to love, she runs off to her friendâ€™s family cabin at Lake Quinault.
When Vivi and the other â€œYa-Yaâ€™sâ€� find out about this, they decide to send Sidda the â€œDivine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhoodâ€� scrapbook to help Sidda understand their lives, and more importantly, her motherâ€™s life, better.
