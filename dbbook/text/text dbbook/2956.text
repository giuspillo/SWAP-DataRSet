The Ghost of Thomas Kempe is a low fantasy novel for children by Penelope Lively, first published by Heinemann in 1973 with illustrations by Anthony Maitland. Set in present-day Oxfordshire, it features a boy and his modern family who are new in their English village, and seem beset by a poltergeist. Soon the boy makes acquaintance with the titular Thomas Kempe, ghost of a 17th-century resident sorcerer who intends to stay. Lively won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject.
Themes
An interest in history, the passage of time and local change is a running theme in the work of Penelope Lively and can be seen in many of her books. Beside Mr Kempe from the 17th century, this story involves both a 19th-century resident of the cottage and the history of the surrounding countryside.
Adaptations
In 1978, a film was made based on the novel, which aired on the ABC Weekend Special , a showcase for a variety of different films aimed at children. The film was re-broadcast many times over the years, and has had several releases on home video. The book was also read on BBC's Jackanory . In 1977, a radio play version was aired over a number of weeks on Australia's ABC radio.
