Pat the Bunny (officially styled as pat the bunny) is a "touch and feel" book for small children and babies and has been a perennial best-seller in the U.S. since its publication in 1940. It is not a book in the traditional sense, but more a collection of things to do, such as pat the fake fur of a rabbit on one page, feel a bit of sandpaper that stands for "daddy's scratchy face" on another, and look in a mirror on yet another. It was written by Dorothy Kunhardt, who was a successful children's author when she wrote Pat the Bunny for her 3-year-old daughter, Edith. It was partly an experiment in using interactive elements in a book, which was unusual at the time.

Pat the Bunny is a "touch and feel" book for small children and babies and has been a perennial best-seller in the United States since its publication in 1940 . It is not a book in the traditional sense, but more a collection of things to do, such as pat the fake fur of a rabbit on one page, feel a bit of sandpaper that stands for "daddy's scratchy face" on another, and look in a mirror on yet another.
It was written by Dorothy Kunhardt , who was a successful children's author when she wrote Pat the Bunny for her 3-year-old daughter, Edith. [1] It was partly an experiment in using interactive elements in a book, which was unusual at the time. [2]
Reception and legacy
Since its publication, Pat the Bunny has sold over 6 million copies, making it the number-6 all-time bestselling children's hardcover book, according to Publishers Weekly. [3] Edith Kunhardt wrote three companions: Pat the Cat in 1984, Pat the Puppy in 1991, and Pat the Pony in 1997. The publisher, Random House , has developed an entire line of related products, [4] and the company DIC will create a TV series based on the book. [5] [6] The book continues to be popular, appearing as eleventh best selling children's illustrated book for the week of June 15, 2006. [7] Golden Press makes more than a quarter million copies a year. [2] The book was endorsed by experts in child development for its "developmental features" and "sensory approach". [8] In August 2004, Classic Media and Evergreen Concepts partnered to help promote the Pat the Bunny brand. [9] On March 4, 2008, a DVD of the book was released with interactive materials included and an interview with Jean Kunhardt, the author's granddaughter. [10] In 2011, Random House Children's Books released a ""pat the bunny"" app, inspired by the original book, for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch [11] which received critical acclaim. [12]
There have been parodies of the book also, such as Pat the Politician, mocking contemporary political figures, [13] and Pat the Yuppie , which includes activities like touching the sheepskin seatcovers of their new BMW and rubbing the exposed brick of their new condominium's wall. [14]
The proceeds from Pat the Bunny support I Am Your Child, a national public awareness campaign created by the Reiner Foundation to stress the importance of early brain development. [15]
