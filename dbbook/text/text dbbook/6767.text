Air Babylon is a 2005 book by British journalist Imogen Edwards-Jones and "anonymous", described as "a trawl through the highs, the lows, and the rapid descents of the travel industry". It combines various allegedly true incidents into a fictionalized day in the life of a duty manager at London Heathrow airport. The day ends with a plane journey from London to Dubai. Air Babylon follows the 2004 book Hotel Babylon and is published by Bantam. In October 2007 it was announced that Carnival Films had begun development on a television adaptation of the book.
Wedding Babylon
Wedding Babylon (2009) explores the wedding industry. The book lifts the veil on the excesses of the wedding industry - the scams which inflate the prices of everything from flowers to cakes to marquee hire and the wedding disaster stories of high jinxing at the altar and disastrous low comedy in the speeches.

It highlights how the potential for things to go horribly wrong is never higher than at a wedding and how the dream day is never far from becoming a nightmare. The book was reviewed in the Daily Mail. [6]
Wedding Babylon follows the style of Hotel Babylon and Air Babylon. The book is published by Bantam Press .
