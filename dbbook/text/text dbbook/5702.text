Reception
Algis Budrys , after noting that Delany "has about as little discipline as any writer who has tried his hand" at science fiction and that The Einstein Intersection was a book "whose structure and purpose on its own terms are not realized," declared that Delany "simply operates on a plane which Robert Heinlein never dreamed of, nor John W. Campbell , nor â€“ take a deep breath â€“ Ted Sturgeon , Ray Bradbury , nor anyone else we could have put forward as being a poet" before 1960 and "urgently recommended" the novel." [3]
