Possum Magic is an award-winning picture book by Australian author Mem Fox. The two main characters are Grandma Poss and Hush. Hush has been made invisible by Grandma to protect her from Australian bush dangers. The story details the duo's adventures as they tour Australia searching for the secret to Hush's visibility. It is a rhythmical story of Australia's varied landscapes and the animals in them. Fox wrote her first draft for Possum Magic in 1978 during a course in children’s literature at Flinders University. Over five years, nine publishers rejected the draft. When it was accepted by Omnibus Books in Adelaide they asked Fox to reduce the four-and-a-half page book, then titled Hush the Invisible Mouse, by two-thirds and to change the mice to Australian animals to place emphasis on her Australian theme. As of 2011, Possum Magic sold three million copies.
