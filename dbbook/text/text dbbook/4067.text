A Pocket Full of Rye is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on November 9, 1953, and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at ten shillings and sixpence (10/6) and the US edition at $2.75. The book features her detective Miss Marple. Like several of Christie's novels the title and substantial parts of the plot reference a nursery rhyme, in this case Sing a Song of Sixpence.
Plot summary
Captain Hastings has breakfast in the flat that he shares with Poirot in London. In the morning mail, Poirot finds an extraordinary letter: "For God's sake, come!" writes Monsieur Paul Renauld. Directly, Poirot and Hastings go to Renauld's home, the Villa Genevieve in Merlinville-sur-Mer on the north coast of France. Asking for directions near the villa, they are watched by a beautiful girl who has "anxious eyes". At the gates, they learn that Renaud has been murdered this morning; the police are present. Renauld and his wife were attacked in their rooms at 2:00 am by two masked and bearded men. Madame Renauld was tied up and her husband taken away. Entry to the house was through the open front door. Renaud's body was found, stabbed in the back, in a newly-dug open grave on the edge of an adjacent golf course. The grave was in the area of a bunker which was due to be dug that day. Renauld had sent his son Jack away on business to South America; given the chauffeur a holiday, leaving only three female servants in the house; and his secretary, Gabriel Stoner, remains in England. One servant tells Poirot and the police that the night before â€“ and often, in recent days â€“ after Madame Renauld had retired to bed for the night, her husband was visited by the neighbour, Madame Daubreuil, who is the mother of Marthe Daubreuil, the girl with the "anxious eyes". Another servant says it was an unknown woman who came the day before, whom Renauld urged to "leave now". There is a smashed watch at the scene, a long piece of lead pipe, a love letter signed by "Bella", the fragment of a check with the name "Duveen", and the murder weapon, a letter opener used as a dagger. One upper storey window could be accessed by a tree; Poirot considers the matter of footprints in the flower beds near the tree the most important of the clues. After telling her story, the widow inspects the body to identify it. She collapses with grief at the sight of her dead husband. Poirot investigates in Renauld's name, while the French magistrate and police do their work. Monsieur Giraud of the SÃ»retÃ© is overtly hostile to Poirot. The Examining Magistrate, Monsieur Hautet, is not, however, and shares key information with Poirot. He tells Poirot that Renaud changed his will just two weeks before, leaving almost everything to his wife and nothing to his son, and that Mme Daubreuil has paid two hundred thousand francs into her bank account in recent weeks. The lady rejects the suggestion they were lovers. Her anxious daughter pursues Poirot to learn if anyone is named as a suspect in Renauld's murder. The mother's face is familiar to Poirot from news photos of a case long ago. Unexpectedly, Hastings encounters the young lady "Cinderella" at the golf course, the same woman he met once on a train to Calais. She asks to be shown the exciting crime scenes, then disappears as unexpectedly as she had arrived, taking the murder weapon with her. Stoner returns, suggesting blackmail is more likely than an affair, as Renauld's past before his career in South America is a mystery. Jack Renauld returns home, his ship having been delayed. Jack admits to having had an argument with his father over who he wants to marry, but shows he is unaware of the change in the will. Marthe Daubreuil is the girl in question, considered unsuitable to both his parents. Poirot goes to Paris to conduct research. While he is away, another body is found with the dagger in his heart. No one recognises the wellâ€“dressed man who, by his hands, could be a tramp. The man has been dead for forty-eight hours, since before Monsieur Renauld's murder. Back from Paris, Poirot examines the new corpse together with the doctor. The foam on the dead man's lips leads the doctor to realise that the man died of an epileptic fit, and was stabbed after death. Renauld's murder is similar to a famous case 22 years earlier. Young Mme Beroldy was on trial for the death of her middle-aged husband. He was murdered by two masked men who broke into their house at night. Mme Beroldy had a young lover, Georges Conneau, who absconded from justice but wrote a letter to the police admitting to the crime; there were no masked men and he stabbed the husband. He confessed because he learned that Mme Beroldy did not love him, but planned to marry yet another man once widowed. Mme Beroldy managed a tearful performance in the witness box, convincing the jury of her innocence. She and her young daughter left Paris. Giraud concludes that Jack Renauld murdered his father, seeking to claim his inheritance without delay, and arrests him. Poirot notes two flaws in Giraud's theory: there was no advantage to Jack in murdering his father unless his father's body was discovered promptly; and the presence of the piece of lead pipe near the corpse remains unexplained. Poirot deduces that Paul Renauld was Georges Conneau. He fled France to Canada, gaining a wife and a son, then making his fortune in South America. When the family later settle in France, by great misfortune their immediate neighbour is Mme Beroldy, now Mme Daubreuil, who blackmails him. Worse, his son falls in love with her daughter. When a tramp dies on his grounds of an epileptic fit, Renauld sees a chance to repeat the ruse of years earlier, but with one change. He will fake his own death to escape his blackmailer. He first sends away those who could recognise him, then stages his kidnapping by tying his wife up and disappearing. The tramp's body, disfigured by the lead pipe, will be buried, and Renauld will leave on the last train. The plan was foiled when Renauld was stabbed by someone else after he finished digging the grave but before he could fetch the tramp's body. Thus his wife, when shown the first dead body, was truly shocked to discover it was her husband's after all. Jack is released from prison when Bella Duveen confesses to the murder, falsely. Jack tells Poirot how the two arrived by chance simultaneously at the site of his father's death. Poirot realises that leaves only one with a motive: Marthe Daubreuil. She overheard the Renaulds discussing the ruse, and she stabbed Renauld on the golf course after he had dug the grave. Poirot asks Mme Renauld to openly disinherit Jack, so he will leave his mother alone in the house and give Marthe a motive to kill her. Marthe dies trying to kill Mme Renauld, who is saved by Cinderella. Marthe's mother disappears again. Jack and his mother plan to go to South America, joined by Hastings and Dulcie Duveen, who is his Cinderella and Bella's twin sister.
Literary significance and reception
Philip John Stead in The Times Literary Supplement , 4 December 1953 wrote that "Miss Christie's novel belongs to the comfortable branch of detective fiction; it never harrows its readers by realistic presentation of violence or emotion or by making exorbitant demands on their interest in the characters. Crime is a convention, pursuit an intellectual exercise, and it is as if the murderer of the odious financier did but poison in jest. The characters are lightly and deftly sketched and an antiseptic breeze of humour prevails. It is a pleasure to read an author so nicely conscious of the limitations of what she is attempting." He concluded, "Miss Christie has a reputation for playing fair with the reader who likes to assume detective responsibility, and also for being one too many for him. In the present case it may be felt that the hidden mechanism of the plot is ingenious at the expense of probability, but the tale is told with such confidence that (like murder itself, in this pastoral atmosphere) it does not matter very much." [4]
Maurice Richardson in The Observer (15 November 1953) posited, "Not quite so stunning as some of Mrs Christie's criminal assaults upon her readers; the soufflÃ© rises all right, but the red herrings aren't quite nifty enough. But how well she nearly always writes, the dear decadent old death-trafficker; they ought to make her a Dame or a D. Litt ." [5]
Robert Barnard : "Super-stockbrokerbelt setting, and quite exceptionally nasty family of suspects. (Christie usually prefers to keep most of her characters at least potentially sympathetic as well as potential murderers, but here they are only the latter). Something of a re-run of Hercule Poirot's Christmas (loathsome father, goody-goody son, ne'er-do-well son, gold-digger wife, etc.), but without its tight construction and ingenuity. And the rhyme is an irrelevancy. Still, a good, sour read." [6]
