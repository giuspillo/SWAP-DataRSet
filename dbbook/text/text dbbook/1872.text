Plot summary
Freeglader starts in the capital of the Edge, Undertown . The city is slowly being destroyed by a dark maelstrom, triggered by Vox Verlix . The Undertowners begin a mass exodus, fleeing to a new life in a vast, beautiful area of justice and equality, the Free Glades . The exodus is led by Rook Barkwater , the hero of the story, and the others in a breakaway group of academics known as the librarian knights. On the journey to the Free Glades Rook gets caught up in a storm near the Twilight Woods, causing him to lose his memory. Upon reaching the Deepwoods the exodus is attacked by the recently hatched battle flocks of Shrykes. Only through the timely arrival of the Freeglade Lancers are the Librarians and Undertowners saved (combined with Xanth killing the Roost mother). Meanwhile Amberfuce has reached the Foundry Glade . There he presents his partner with plans for Glade Eaters , special weapons designed by Vox Verlix. The two along with the Goblin Nations begin plans for an attack on the Free Glades. Rook, meanwhile having regained his memory, joins the Free Lancers. Xanth, his name cleared, joins the Librarian Knights. Everything is peaceful for several months until the attack comes. The massive Glade Eaters , backed by the armies of the Goblin Nations, destroy most of the Free Glades before being destroyed. The Sky Pirates, the Librarian Knights, the Freeglade Lancers and the Ghosts of Screetown fight determinedly but are outnumbered. Even the arrival of the banderbears fails to turn the tide. However, at the last minute large numbers of peaceful goblins revolt, killing the Goblin Chieftains. The war ends, and everyone sets about rebuilding the Free Glades.
