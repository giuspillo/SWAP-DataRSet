Film, TV or theatrical adaptations
The Secret World of Og served to inspire an animated action-adventure television series produced in 2006 and airing on CBC Television , Canada's national public broadcaster. The series also airs in the United States on Starz Kids and Family with a TV-PG rating, despite its family-oriented nature.
An animated special based on the book, also called The Secret World of Og, was previously broadcast in the 1980s in the United States as an ABC Weekend Special during its 5th Season.
The TV series extends the storyline of the original book, following the five Berton siblings as they descend through a hole in the floor of their playhouse to explore the underground world of Og. There, amid subterranean rivers, caverns and elaborate villages built of mushrooms, they interact with little green creatures called Ogs, and their myriad neighbors - trolls , ogres and fairies , and a mysterious sea monster named Nessie .
Carousel Theatre produced a stage version of The Secret World of Og in April 2009 in Vancouver, BC, adapted by Governor General's Award winning playwright Kevin Kerr .
The Canadian Children's Opera Company (CCOC) will mount an operatic version in May 2010 at the Enwave Theatre of the Harbourfront Centre, Toronto . The Secret World of Og, with libretto and music by Dean Burry, is directed by Joel Ivany and conducted by Ann Cooper Gay.
