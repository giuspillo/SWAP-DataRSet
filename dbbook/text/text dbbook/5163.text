Plot summary
Coraline Jones and her parents move into an old house that has been divided into flats. The other tenants include Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, two elderly women retired from the stage, and Mr. Bobo, who claims to be training a mouse circus. The flat beside Coraline's remains empty.
During a rainy day she discovers a locked door in a downstairs room. She gets the key from her mother and opens the door to discover that it has been bricked up. As she goes to visit her neighbours, Mr. Bobinsky relates to her a message from his mice: Don't go through the door. At tea with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, Miss Spink spies danger in Coralineâ€™s future after reading her tea leaves, and gives her a lucky stone. The ladies explain that the stone will make the unseen seen.
Despite these warnings, Coraline decides to unlock the door when she is home by herself. This time, she finds the brick wall behind the door gone. In its place is a long hallway that leads to a flat identical to her own, inhabited by her Other Mother and Other Father. They look like her parents, except that in place of eyes, they have shiny black buttons. The Other Mother, however, is notably different from her real mother, in that she is taller and thinner. Her black hair seems to move by itself, her skin is paper-white, and her nails are long and red. In this â€œOther Worldâ€�, Coraline finds everything to be better than her reality: her Other Parents are attentive, her toy box is filled with animate toys that can move and fly, and the Other Miss Spink and Miss Forcible forever perform a cabaret show in their flat. She even finds that the feral Black Cat that wanders around the house in the real world can talk; however, she learns he is not of the Other World; he can travel from one world to the other, and has done so to warn Coraline of imminent danger, but Coraline pays him no heed. The Other Mother and other inhabitants of the Other World do not like the Black Cat.
The Other Mother offers Coraline the opportunity to stay in the Other World forever, and to do so, Coraline must allow buttons to be sewn into her eyes. Coraline is horrified and returns through the door to her home. Upon her return to her apartment, Coraline finds her real parents are missing. They do not return the next day, and the black cat wakes her and takes her to a mirror in her hallway, through which she can see her trapped parents. They signal to her by writing "Help Us" on the glass, from which Coraline deduces the Other Mother has kidnapped them. Though frightened of returning, Coraline goes back to the Other World to confront the Other Mother and rescue her parents. In the garden, Coraline is prompted by the Cat to challenge the Other Mother, as â€œher kind of thing loves games and challengesâ€�. The Other Mother tries to convince Coraline to stay, but Coraline refuses, and is locked within a mirror as punishment.
Behind the mirror is darkness and a small space like a closet. There, she meets three ghost children, each from a different era. They had let the beldame (the Other Mother) sew buttons in their eyes. They tell Coraline how she eventually grew bored with them, and eventually they died and she cast their spirits aside. But they are trapped there because she has kept their souls. If their souls can be rescued from the Other Mother, then the ghosts can pass on. The ghost children implore Coraline to avoid their fate.
After the Other Mother releases Coraline from the mirror, Coraline proposes a game: if she can find the ghost children's souls and her parents, then she, her parents and the ghost children may go free. If she loses, then Coraline will let the Other Mother sew the buttons into her eyes and become a loving daughter to her.
Coraline searches through the Other World, overcomes all of the Other Mother's obstacles, uses her wits and Miss Spink's stone to locate the ghost children's souls and her parents, who are imprisoned in a snow globe on the mantle. The ghost children warn her that even if Coraline wins, the Other Mother will not let them go. So Coraline tricks the Other Mother: she announces that she knows her parents are hidden in the passageway between the worlds. The Other Mother cannot resist gloating by opening the door to show Coraline that her parents are not there. But as the Other Mother opens the door, Coraline throws the cat at the Other Mother, grabs the snow globe, and escapes to the real world with the key, and the Cat quickly follows. In escaping, she forces the door shut on the Other Mother's hand, severing it. Back in her home, Coraline finds her parents safe and with no memory of the events.
That night, Coraline has a dream in which she meets the three children before they move on to the afterlife. They warn her that her task is still not done: the other mother's severed hand is in Coraline's world, and will not stop until it locates and uses the key to open the door that connects the two worlds. Coraline goes to an old well in the woods by her house, luring the Other Motherâ€™s hand there with the key, and tricks the Other Mother's hand into falling down a near-bottomless old well, along with the key. Coraline returns home, victorious, and prepares to go about the ordinary life she has come to accept and love.
Characters
Coraline Jones â€“ The young explorer. She is curious, intelligent, resourceful, and courageous. Coraline is often irritated by rain, crazy grown-ups (as they all seem to be), and not being taken seriously because of her young age. She's described as being "small for her age," but Coraline is not afraid to face anyone; she is the most adventurous person in the book.
Mrs. Jones â€“ Coraline's mother.She is very busy most of the time, and sometimes a little inattentive, but she loves and cares about Coraline. She is nice, and helpful, though Coraline considers her to be rather boring. Coraline also gets annoyed with her real mother because she doesn't seem to want to let Coraline "fit in".
Mr. Jones â€“ Coraline's father. He works at his house on the computer. He cares about Coraline very much and is kind, brave and helpful. He makes interesting food creations that Coraline strongly dislikes. He too is usually too busy to spend time with Coraline.
The Cat â€“ A black cat from Coraline's world. The cat acts as a mentor to Coraline and guides her through her journey. He claims to have no name, explaining that cats do not need names to tell each other apart. Unlike many of the characters in the novel, he does not have an "Other World" counterpart, saying that unlike other creatures in the world, cats can "keep themselves together". He moves freely from one world to the other, although he can only talk in the Other Mother's world. He is very sarcastic , though helpful towards Coraline. He's defiant of the Other Mother, but seems to tremble at the thought of being stuck in the Other Mother's world. He befriends Coraline and helps her escape from the Other Mother.
The Other Mother â€“ The creature that created much of the Other World and the main villain of the novel. She looks similar to Coraline's real mother but taller and thinner, with long black hair that seems to move by itself, black button eyes, paper-white skin, and extremely long, twitchy fingers with long dark red nails. During the course of the novel, she grows taller, thinner, and paler, looking less and less like Coraline's mother. She cannot create, but only copy, twist and change things from the real world when constructing her version of it. She collects children, with whom she quickly becomes bored or frustrated, and imprisons them behind a magical mirror , slowly sucking the life from them. In the film her true form is a spidery, skeletal creature. She is referred to several times as "the beldam ", a Middle English word meaning "grandmother," "ugly old woman," or "hag", and also used to refer to creatures of faery. However, the French for 'Belle-dame' is 'Beautiful lady'. There are connotations to 'Belle-mÃ¨re' which literally translates as 'Beautiful Mother' but means 'Step-mother' which applies to the 'other mother'.
The Other Father â€“ A creation of the Other Mother, who is used to help trick Coraline into staying in the Other Mother's world. Like her real father, he has a study and sits there during the day and will not talk to Coraline for long. He does not work, however; he merely occupies the study, as he is not permitted to talk to Coraline by himself. He is much more fun than Coraline's real father and always tries to be cheerful and fun in front of Coraline. In reality, the Other Father is sad and nervous. The Other Mother ends up punishing him for revealing too much to Coralineâ€”she transforms him into a grub -like creature, and orders the Other Father to trap Coraline so she cannot win her challenge, but Coraline escapes.
Miss April Spink and Miss Miriam Forcible â€“ A pair of retired actresses who live in the flat under Coraline's. They own many ageing Scotties , such as Hamish, Angus and Jock, and talk in theatre jargon, often referencing their time as actresses. They recognise the danger Coraline is in after reading her fortune through tea leaves and give her a stone with a hole in it to help protect her. In the other world they are young, pretty, and perform unendingly in front of many different dogs, who, in the Other World, behave like humans.
Mr. Bobo (In the film known as "Mr. Bobinsky") â€“ A retired circus performer living in the flat above Coraline's; he is commonly referred to as the Crazy Old Man Upstairs. Over the course of the book he claims to be training mice to perform in a mouse circus , and often brings Coraline messages from them, though at first Coraline doubts he even has mice to train, and doesn't listen to what he says to be messages from the mice. His counterpart in the Other World trains rats, and is in fact made of rats .
The three ghost children â€“ A trio of children who were previously victims of the Other Mother: two girls and one boy. The boy is described as having a dirty face and red trousers. One of the girls has brown hair, a pink blouse and a pink skirt. The other has a brown bonnet and brown dress. They were trapped by the other mother at different times before Coraline, and reside in the dark space behind the mirror. After having their souls restored, they go to the afterlife , but not before meeting Coraline for a last time, in a dream where she picnics with them. Here, she sees their true appearances and they thank her for freeing them from the Other Mother.
