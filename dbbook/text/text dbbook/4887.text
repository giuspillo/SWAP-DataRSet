Billy and the Boingers Bootleg is the fifth collection of the comic strip series Bloom County by Berkeley Breathed. It was published in 1987. It is preceded by Bloom County Babylon and followed by Tales Too Ticklish to Tell. The book includes a flexi disc with two Billy and the Boingers songs: "I'm A Boinger" and "U-Stink-But-I-♥-U". "U-Stink-But-I-♥-U" was performed by New Jersey hardcore band, Mucky Pup who also rerecorded the song for their second album, A Boy In A Man's World. The track remains the band's signature song and is still played live to close out their shows. The cover artwork contains parodies of the covers of two of the best-selling rock albums of 1986/87: the front cover is a send-up of Bruce Springsteen's box set "Live/1975–85"; the back cover includes a spoof of U2's "The Joshua Tree" (the original blurry/"narrow-heads" version of the cover; the spoof deliberately imitates these traits). In both cases, the band member(s) in the original artwork are substituted with members of Billy and the Boingers.
