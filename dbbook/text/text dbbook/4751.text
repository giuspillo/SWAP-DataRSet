The Sunday Philosophy Club is the first of the Sunday Philosophy Club series of novels by Alexander McCall Smith, set in Edinburgh, Scotland, and featuring the protagonist Isabel Dalhousie. It was first published in 2004.
Plot synopsis
Isabel Dalhousie is a philosopher in her early forties and lives alone in a large aging house in the south of Edinburgh. Thanks to a large inheritance left to her by her late mother, she is able to work for a nominal fee as the editor of the Review of Applied Ethics . Her closest friends are her niece Cat, a young attractive woman who runs a delicatessen ; her housekeeper Grace, an outspoken woman with an interest in spiritualism ; Catâ€™s ex-boyfriend Jamie, a bassoonist to whom Isabel has been secretly attracted ever since they met; and Brother Fox, an urban fox who lives in Isabelâ€™s garden.
During a trip to the theatre, Isabel sees a young man fall to his death from the gods . As the young man falls, she catches his eye, and sees an expression of shock of his face, which suggests to her that the policeâ€™s verdict of suicide is wrong. She decides to find out what really happened.
Development
The original title of the book was The Crushed Strawberry, named for the colour of Tobyâ€™s trousers, but it was changed to The Sunday Philosophy Club after a suggestion by McCall Smithâ€™s editor. [1] The book marks the first literary appearance of the Really Terrible Orchestra , a real-life amateur orchestra co-founded by McCall in 1995. [2]
Reception
The book garnered mixed reviews, with many reviewers comparing it unfavourably to McCall Smithâ€™s better-known series The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency . The New York Times sees Isabel as a â€œ(No. 2) Lady Detective Philosopherâ€� (in comparison to the â€˜No. 1 Lady Detectiveâ€™ Precious Ramotswe ) and describes her philosophical musings as â€œless than rivetingâ€�; it concludes that the novel is â€œthe literary equivalent of herbal tea and a cozy fireâ€�. [3] BookReporter.com agrees, calling the story â€œslightly ponderousâ€� and advising that â€œthe tone is a bit daunting for readers who never progressed beyond Philosophy 101 in collegeâ€�. [4] Likewise, The Times Online calls the novel â€œairless and exhaustingâ€� and adds that â€œWe can only hope that the Sunday Philosophy Club remains indefinitely postponedâ€�. [5]
However, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch calls Isabel â€œthe anti-Preciousâ€� and suggests that the novel will â€œdelight McCall Smith's existing fans and win him some new onesâ€�. [6] USA Today 's review was also positive, commending Isabelâ€™s penchant for philosophical self-examination and seeing the novel as a â€œpainless introduction to philosophical questionsâ€�. [7]
RTÃ‰ â€™s website agrees that â€œMcCall Smith makes some excellent points about the absence of moral responsibilityâ€� but finds that Isabelâ€™s lack of flaws and wealthy status make her difficult to identify with: â€œIf McCall Smith had presented a heroine with more questionable ethics, this might have been a far more interesting story.â€� [8]
McCall Smithâ€™s descriptions of Edinburgh are generally commended for their veracity: for example, the San Francisco Chronicle calls them â€œvivid and seamlessâ€�. [9]
