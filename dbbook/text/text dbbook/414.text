Weapons of Choice is the first novel of the Axis of Time alternate history trilogy, written by Australian author John Birmingham.
2021
The book starts in 2021 off East Timor , as a US-led Multinational Taskforce , commanded by Admiral Phillip Kolhammer , prepares to liberate the Indonesian islands from an Islamic government calling itself the Caliphate, which is slaughtering Chinese citizens. In the book's backstory, the Chinese government was planning to send a task force but was warned by the American government not to do so. The flagship of the taskforce is the aircraft carrier USS Hillary Clinton, named after "the most uncompromising wartime president in the history of the United States". The task force is made up mainly of American and British units alongside French , Australian , Japanese and Free Indonesians , along with a few other units like Spetsnaz from Russia and Kommando SpezialkrÃ¤fte from Germany. Alongside the navy taskforce is the JRV Nagoya, a scientific ship which is experimenting with wormholes ; the navy ship protecting it is ordered to join the taskforce. A new ship from the Royal New Zealand Navy is sent as escort, but prior to its arrival, the Nagoya's project director, Manning Pope, decides to make a trial run. The taskforce is constantly watched by a Caliphate spy on the mainland.
1942
Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance and Lt. Commander Daniel Black are on the bridge of the USS Enterprise , on their way to face the Japanese sent to invade Midway . A growing commotion outside the bridge prompts them to investigate, only to find a large group of what are, to them, unknown and strangely designed ships. They spot a ship with the Japanese ensign and assume it is the Japanese fleet sent against Midway and they order their own ships to open fire. The multinational taskforce Combat Intelligence, referred to as CI, takes defensive action; the 21st century fleet nearly wipes out the American fleet, including the USS Hornet and USS Yorktown . During the battle, Kolhammer and the rest of the Multinational Taskforce commanders learn that not all ships of the taskforce came through and those that did, did not all end up in the same place.
The HJIMS RyÅ«jÅ� encounters the Free Indonesian ship KRI Sutanto and boards it. The Indonesians are taken captive, the Japanese learn of the force sent against them at Midway and the rest of the Japanese navy is warned and ordered back home.

However, murders, rapes and riots happen as the 21st century people try to mix with the locals. Kolhammer is flown to California to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Albert Einstein . As time goes by with no sight of the JRV Nagoya, more and more 21st century personnel start to realise they are stuck in 1942.
Captain Karen Halabi and the HMS Trident, a Trident-class trimaran stealth destroyer, is ordered back to the Home Island for evaluation and possible transfer of the Trident.
