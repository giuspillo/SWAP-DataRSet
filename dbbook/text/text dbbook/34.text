Ancient Evenings is a novel by American author Norman Mailer. It deals with the lives of two protagonists, one young, one old, in a very alien Ancient Egypt marked by journeys by the dead, reincarnation, and violent and hyper-sexual gods and mortals in a complex combination of historical fiction, allegory, poetic flight, confession and spiritual meditation. The novel had an extremely mixed critical reception marked by a preponderance of negative reviews. William S. Burroughs acknowledged "Norman Mailer and his Ancient Evenings, for inspiration" in his 1987 novel The Western Lands. The novel has gained popularity in Turkey due to its resemblance to the novel My Name is Red by the Nobel Prize winner Turkish author Orhan Pamuk. Pamuk was accused of plagiarizing many parts of the novel.
