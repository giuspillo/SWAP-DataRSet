Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist is a 1950 book about Friedrich Nietzsche by Walter Kaufmann; revised editions were published in 1956, 1968, and 1974. Philip Rieff called it the best book in English on Nietzsche. Richard Schacht writes that Kaufmann's Nietzsche is a classic and widely read study through which many English-speaking readers after World War II became interested in and acquainted with Nietzsche. Michael Tanner considers the book an "ill-organized transformation of Nietzsche into a liberal humanist", albeit one that "has its place in the history of Nietzsche reception."
