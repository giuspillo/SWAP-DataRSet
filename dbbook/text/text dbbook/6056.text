Death du Jour is the second novel by Kathy Reichs starring forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan.
Plot
On a bitterly cold March night in Montreal , Canada , Brennan is exhuming the remains of a nun proposed for sainthood in the grounds of a church. Hours later she's called to the scene of an horrific arson, where a young family has perished. There seem to be no witnesses, motive and no explanation. From the charred remains of the inferno to a trail of sinister cult activity which leads her to Beaufort, South Carolina and a terrifying showdown during an ice storm back in Canada, Brennan faces a test of both her forensic expertise and her survival instinct.
