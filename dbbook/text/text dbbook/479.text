Plot introduction
The strange world Jon-Tom has found himself trapped in takes a turn for the decidedly weird as Fosterâ€™s fantasy series take a page from Kafka's The Metamorphosis when the Spellsinger wakes up one morning as a giant crab. The cause, as determined by the turtle wizard Clothahump , is a trapped perambulator: an inter-dimensional creature that wanders through different universes leaving behind random changes to the fabric of the world. Jon-Tom and his friends attempt to free the perambulator before it wreaks permanent havoc on their world.
