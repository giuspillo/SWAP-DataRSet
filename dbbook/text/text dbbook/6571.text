Harriet the Spy is a children's novel written and illustrated by Louise Fitzhugh that was published in 1964. It has been called "a milestone in children’s literature" and a "classic."
Plot summary
Eleven-year-old Harriet M. Welsch is an aspiring writer who lives in New York City's Upper East Side . A precocious and enthusiastic girl, Harriet enjoys writing and aspires to become a spy . Encouraged by her nanny, Ole Golly, Harriet carefully observes others and writes her thoughts down in a notebook as practice for her future career, which she dedicates her life to. She follows an afternoon "spy route", during which she observes her classmates, friends, and people who reside in her neighborhood. Her best friends are Sport, a serious boy who lives with his father, and Janie, an aspiring scientist.
Harriet enjoys having structure in her life. For example, she regularly eats tomato sandwiches and adamantly refuses to consume other types of sandwiches. However, Harriet's routine life is abruptly changed when her parents attend a party. Ole Golly and her suitor , Mr. Waldenstein, take Harriet out for dessert and a movie. When they return home, they discover that the Welsches have returned early to an empty house. When Mrs. Welsch attempts to fire Ole Golly, Mr. Waldenstein discloses to the Welsches that he proposed to Ole Golly that evening, and she has accepted. In an astonishing about-face, Mrs. Welsch exclaims, "You can't leave, what will we do without you?!" Ole Golly replies that she had planned to leave soon because she believes Harriet is old enough to care for herself. Harriet is crushed by the loss of her nanny, to whom she was very close.
Later at school, during a game of tag, Harriet loses her notebook. Her classmates find it and are appalled at her brutally honest documentation of her opinions of them. For example, in her notebook she compares Sport to a "little old woman" for his continual worrying about his father. The students form a "Spy Catcher Club" in which they think up ways to make Harriet's life miserable, such as stealing her lunch, passing nasty notes about her in class, and spilling ink on her.
Harriet regularly spies on them through a back fence and concocts vengeful ways to punish them. She realizes the consequences of the mean things she wrote, and though she is hurt and lonely, she still thinks up special punishments for each member of the club. After getting into trouble for carrying out some of her plans, Harriet tries to resume her friendship with Sport and Janie as if nothing had ever happened, but they both reject her. Harriet spends all her time in class writing in her notebook as a part of her plan to punish the Spy Catcher Club. As a result of never doing her schoolwork, her grades suffer. This leads Harriet's parents to confiscate her notebook. Hearing of Harriet's troubles, Ole Golly writes to her, telling her that if anyone ever reads her notebook, "you have to do two things, and you don't like either one of them. 1: You have to apologize. 2: You have to lie. Otherwise you are going to lose a friend."
Meanwhile, dissent is rippling through the Spy Catcher Club. Marion, the teacher's pet, and her best friend Rachel are calling all the shots, and Sport and Janie are tired of being bossed around. When they quit the club, most of their classmates do the same.
Harriet's parents speak with her teacher and the headmistress, and Harriet is appointed editor of the class newspaper. The newspaperâ€”featuring stories about the people on Harriet's spy route and the students' parentsâ€”becomes an instant success. Harriet also uses the paper to make amends by printing a retraction and is forgiven.
Reception
The book appeared on a 1964 list of "The Year's Best Juveniles" in The New York Times Book Review . [3] One 1965 reviewer called the book "a brilliantly written, unsparing realistic story, a superb portrait of an extraordinary child." [4] Another reviewer found that it "captures the feelings, thoughts and situations of a modern city child with remarkable clarity and dimension." [5] Nevertheless, at least one reviewer in 1965 felt that the book dealt with "disagreeable people and situations." [6] Although it was not chosen as one of the American Library Association (ALA) Notable Books for Children for 1964, years later it was included in a retrospective 1960-1964 ALA Notable Books List. [1]
It won a Sequoyah Book Award in 1967. [7] The paperback version was selected as one of the "Best in the Field" published during the previous 16 months in a 1968 New York Times article. [8] In 1995, Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies claimed that 2.5 million copies of the book had been sold; [9] however, the book did not appear on a 2001 Publishers Weekly list of "hardcovers that have sold 750,000 copies and paperbacks that have topped the one million copy mark." [10]
Whitney Matheson wrote on the USA Today site in 2002 that Harriet "attracts dedicated, lifelong supporters." [11] Anita Silvey in 2004 selected it as one of the 100 best books for children. [12] In 2005, the ex- CIA officer Lindsay Moran cited the Harriet the Spy series of books as an inspiration for her career. [13] It was included in a 2009 list of "Childrenâ€™s Classics" by The Horn Book Magazine . [14]
In a 2012 online poll of "Top 100 Children's Novels" by School Library Journal , the book ranked 17th. [15] The book was 12th on a 2012 list of "The 50 Best Books for Kids" in Time Out New York Kids . [16]
Despite its popularity, the book has been banned from some schools and libraries "because it was said to set a bad example for children." [2] [17] [18] Along with Are You There God? , Blubber , and Where the Sidewalk Ends , the book was challenged at a famous 1983 school board meeting in Xenia, Ohio . [19] Proponents of the Xenia ban stated that the book "teaches children to lie, spy, back-talk and curse," but the board voted to keep the books in the school libraries. [19] [20]
Although the book does not state the title character's sexuality, lesbians have identified with Harriet due to her being an "outsider" and due to her dressing like a boy. [2] For example, Harriet had high-top sneakers which girls rarely wore in the 1960s. [21] Furthermore, Fitzhugh was known to be a lesbian, and the "Boy with the Purple Socks" character in the book may have been gay as the color purple is associated with the gay community. [21]
