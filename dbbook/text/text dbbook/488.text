The Illuminati Papers is a collection of essays and other works by Robert Anton Wilson first published in 1980. The book expands upon characters and themes from his earlier The Illuminatus! Trilogy and most of the essays are written from the point of view of the characters in Illuminatus! Topics Wilson writes on cover politics, science, the future, hedonism and consciousness. The book's essays and stories are illustrated with line drawings, message banners, cartoons, office memos and interviews. "The RICH Economy" presents Wilson's economic thoughts on Basic income. In it Wilson synthesize several concepts and gives them the acronym RICH. An online version is available. Though the essay is published in 1980, it appears to recapitulate the ideas presented in James S. Albus's 1976, book: Peoples' Capitalism: The Economics of the Robot Revolution, though Albus proposes to prevent inflation through a mandatory savings plan, not through a gradual phase-in of a National Dividend. The Illuminati Papers is sometimes referenced as a sequel to Illuminatus! as are other related works such as Masks of the Illuminati, the Cosmic Trigger, and The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles series of books. The Schrödinger's Cat trilogy novel, however, is most similar in length, writing style, plot devices and the use of parallel universes for the stories' settings.
