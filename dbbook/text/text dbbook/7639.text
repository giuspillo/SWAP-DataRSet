Affluenza: When Too Much is Never Enough is a 2005 book by Professor Clive Hamilton and Richard Denniss. According to the book, Western society is addicted to overconsumption and this situation is unique in human history. Hamilton and Denniss argue that people "aspire to the lifestyles of the rich and famous at the cost of family, friends and personal fulfilment", and that rates of stress, depression and obesity are high as people try to cope with the emptiness and disappointments of consumer life. The authors even assert that some of Australia's richest people believe they do not have enough money to get by, even though Australians are three times richer than they were in 1950. Affluenza says that an increasing number of Australians are ignoring advertisers, reducing their spending, and reprioritizing their time. Affluenza has been criticized as anti-capitalist because "the authors are unashamedly political, harshly criticising John Howard's government for preaching family values while undermining them through materialistic policies that place the market above all else."
