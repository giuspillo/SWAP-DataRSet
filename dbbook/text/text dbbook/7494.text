Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (commonly shortened to Alice in Wonderland) is an 1865 novel written by English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre, and its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.

Writing style and themes
Symbolism
Most of the book's adventures may have been based on and influenced by people, situations and buildings in Oxford and at Christ Church, e.g., the "Rabbit Hole," which symbolised the actual stairs in the back of the main hall in Christ Church. A carving of a griffon and rabbit, as seen in Ripon Cathedral , where Carroll's father was a canon, may have provided inspiration for the tale. [20]
Since Carroll was a mathematician at Christ Church , it has been suggested [21] [22] that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and Through the Looking-Glass ; examples include:
In chapter 1, "Down the Rabbit-Hole", in the midst of shrinking, Alice waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as, perhaps "going out altogether, like a candle"; this pondering reflects the concept of a limit .
In chapter 2, "The Pool of Tears", Alice tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results: "Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven isâ€”oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate!" This explores the representation of numbers using different bases and positional numeral systems : 4 Ã— 5 = 12 in base 18 notation, 4 Ã— 6 = 13 in base 21 notation, and 4 Ã— 7 could be 14 in base 24 notation. Continuing this sequence, going up three bases each time, the result will continue to be less than 20 in the corresponding base notation. (After 4 x 12 = 19 in Base 39, the product would be 4 x 13 = 1A in Base 42, then 1B, 1C, 1D, and so on.)
In chapter 7, "A Mad Tea-Party", the March Hare, the Hatter, and the Dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of a sentence A is not the same value of the converse of A (for example, "Why, you might just as well say that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!"); in logic and mathematics, this is discussing an inverse relationship .
Also in chapter 7, Alice ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning. This is an observation of addition on the ring of integers modulo N.
The Cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely, leaving only its wide grin, suspended in the air, leading Alice to marvel and note that she has seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat. Deep abstraction of concepts, such as non-Euclidean geometry, abstract algebra, and the beginnings of mathematical logic, was taking over mathematics at the time Dodgson was writing. Dodgson's delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself. For example, instead of considering two or three apples, one may easily consider the concept of 'apple', upon which the concepts of 'two' and 'three' may seem to depend. A far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of 'two' and 'three' by themselves, just like a grin, originally seemingly dependent on the cat, separated conceptually from its physical object.
Mathematician Melanie Bayley asserted in the magazine New Scientist that Dodgson wrote Alice in Wonderland in its final form as a scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid-19th century. [23]
It has been suggested by several people, including Martin Gardner and Selwyn Goodacre, [21] that Dodgson had an interest in the French language, choosing to make references and puns about it in the story. It is most likely that these are references to French lessonsâ€”a common feature of a Victorian middle-class girl's upbringing. For example, in the second chapter Alice posits that the mouse may be French. She therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her French lesson-book to it: "OÃ¹ est ma chatte?" ("Where is my cat?"). In Henri BuÃ©'s French translation, Alice posits that the mouse may be Italian and speaks Italian to it.
Pat's "Digging for apples" could be a cross-language pun , as pomme de terre (literally; "apple of the earth") means potato and pomme means apple, which little English girls studying French would easily guess. [24]
In the second chapter, Alice initially addresses the mouse as "O Mouse", based on her memory of the noun declensions "in her brother's Latin Grammar , 'A mouse â€“ of a mouse â€“ to a mouse â€“ a mouse â€“ O mouse!'" These words correspond to the first five of Latin's six cases, in a traditional order established by medieval grammarians: mus ( nominative ), muris ( genitive ), muri ( dative ), murem ( accusative ), (O) mus ( vocative ). The sixth case, mure ( ablative ) is absent from Alice's recitation.
In the eighth chapter, three cards are painting the roses on a rose tree red, because they had accidentally planted a white-rose tree that The Queen of Hearts hates. Red roses symbolised the English House of Lancaster , while white roses were the symbol for their rival House of York . This scene is an allusion to the Wars of the Roses . [25]
Eating and devouring
Carina Garland notes how the world is "expressed via representations of food and appetite", naming Alice's frequent desire for consumption (of both food and words), her 'Curious Appetites'. [26] Often, the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images. After the riddle â€œWhy is a raven like a writing-desk?â€�, the Hatter claims that Alice might as well say, â€œI see what I eatâ€¦I eat what I seeâ€� and so the riddleâ€™s solution, put forward by Boe Birns, [27] could be that "A raven eats worms; a writing desk is worm-eaten"; this idea of food encapsulates idea of life feeding on life, for the worm is being eaten and then becomes the eater  â€“  a horrific image of mortality.
Nina Auerbach discusses how the novel revolves around eating and drinking which â€œmotivates much of her [Alice's] behaviourâ€�, for the story is essentially about things â€œentering and leaving her mouthâ€� [28] The animals of Wonderland are of particular interest, for Alice's relation to them shifts constantly because, as Lovell-Smith states, Alice's changes in size continually reposition her in the food chain, serving as a way to make her acutely aware of the â€˜eat or be eatenâ€™ attitude that permeates Wonderland. [29]
Illustrations
One of the author's own illustrations.
The manuscript was illustrated by Dodgson himself who added 37 illustrationsâ€”printed in a facsimile edition in 1887. [9] John Tenniel provided 42 wood engraved illustrations for the published version of the book. The first print run was destroyed (or sold to America [30] ) at Carroll's request because he was dissatisfied with the quality. The book was reprinted and published in 1866. [9]
John Tenniel 's illustrations of Alice do not portray the real Alice Liddell , who had dark hair and a short fringe.
Alice has provided a challenge for other illustrators, including those of 1907 by Charles Pears and the full series of colour plates and line-drawings by Harry Rountree published in the (inter-War) Children's Press (Glasgow) edition. Other significant illustrators include: Arthur Rackham (1907), Willy Pogany (1929), Mervyn Peake (1946), Ralph Steadman (1967), Salvador DalÃ­ (1969), Graham Overden (1969), Max Ernst (1970) and Peter Blake (1970).
Reception by reviewers
The book Alice in Wonderland failed to be named in an 1888 poll of the most popular children's stories. Generally it received poor reviews with reviewers giving more credit to Tenniel's illustrations than to Carroll's story. At the release of Through the Looking-Glass, the second Alice tale gained in popularity and by the end of the 19th century Sir Walter Besant wrote that Alice in Wonderland "was a book of that extremely rare kind which will belong to all the generations to come until the language becomes obsolete". [31]
Publication history
In 1865, Dodgson's tale was published as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by " Lewis Carroll " with illustrations by John Tenniel . The first print run of 2,000 was held back because Tenniel objected to the print quality. [32] A new edition, released in December of the same year, but carrying an 1866 date, was quickly printed. As it turned out, the original edition was sold with Dodgson's permission to the New York publishing house of Appleton. The binding for the Appleton Alice was virtually identical to the 1866 Macmillan Alice, except for the publisher's name at the foot of the spine. The title page of the Appleton Alice was an insert cancelling the original Macmillan title page of 1865, and bearing the New York publisher's imprint and the date 1866.
The entire print run sold out quickly. Alice was a publishing sensation, beloved by children and adults alike. Among its first avid readers were Queen Victoria and the young Oscar Wilde . The book has never been out of print. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland has been translated into at least 97 languages. [33] There have now been over a hundred editions of the book, as well as countless adaptations in other media, especially theatre and film.
The book is commonly referred to by the abbreviated title Alice in Wonderland, an alternative title popularised by the numerous stage, film and television adaptations of the story produced over the years. Some printings of this title contain both Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There .
