Of Love and Other Demons is a novel by Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez, first published in 1994. In the prologue, García Márquez claims the novel is the fictional representation of a legend the author was told by his grandmother as a child: of a 12 year-old girl who contracts rabies but was believed to be a 'miracle-worker', with long flowing copper hair that continues to grow after death. In this frame-story, it was only after an excavation of tombs that García Márquez is witness to the grave of a similar young girl with long red hair, that he was inspired to write Of Love and Other Demons. Mariana Solanet, however, in García Márquez for Beginners, states this source was invented. She points rather to a story in Daniel Lemaitre's History of Cartagena that García Márquez came across in research for Love in the Time of Cholera. In 2008, the opera Love and Other Demons premiered at the Glyndebourne Festival.
