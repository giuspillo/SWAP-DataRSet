The Cater Street Hangman is a crime novel by Anne Perry. It is the first in a series which features the husband-and-wife team of Thomas and Charlotte Pitt.
Plot introduction
The Cater Street Hangman introduces Inspector Thomas Pitt and Charlotte Ellison , both become regular characters in crime novels by Anne Perry. Set in 1881, the story follows an investigation into the murders of several young women in the streets near the wealthy Ellison family home. [1]
Explanation of the novel's title
Throughout the Thomas Pitt series, Perry uses the names of real neighbourhoods in London as titles of the novels. [1]
Plot summary
In an upper class salon on Cater Street several women discuss, in oblique terms, the death of a local girl. Even though Susannah has recently been out of town and is unaware of the murder, it is bad form for proper women to talk about such matters and so they are careful not to say anything too direct about the way the daughter of a friend was garroted and cut open. Finally, tiring of the game, Charlotte comes out and tells her aunt what she has heard about the murder. Although the victim was of the upper class she quickly gains a reputation as having been a bad seed.
A second death occurs, this time a servant. Again the idea that these women did something to deserve this end is easier to accept than the knowledge that it could happen to anyone else. Only when the third murder happens to a member of the Ellison household do they believe that these crimes might not be a simple case of robbery or jealousy. A young police inspector, Thomas Pitt, has been investigating these crimes and soon arrives to question the Ellison household.
Pitt is the educated son of a gamekeeper and cook. His education and manners let him wander in upper-class circles, while his dress and impolite tactics keep them from becoming entirely comfortable with him. Although Pitt aspires to higher social standing, he requests that he be treated as a middle class working man. None of this endears the inspector to Caroline Ellison, the lady of the house and mother of Sarah, Emily and Charlotte Ellison. [1]
Pitt uses pointed questions and little tact to find the information he needs. He often knows the answers to questions before he speaks and so puts everyone off-guard as they attempt to keep their secrets hidden. Before long, every female suspects every male of being the hangman, much to the detriment of long standing marriages and relationships.
As the investigation into who is killing the young women progresses, Thomas falls in love with the unconventional Charlotte. Outwardly, Charlotte is a model of Victorian society, but she does not wish to become one of the mindless women she sees everyday. Instead, she reads newspapers that are smuggled out of her father's sight and speaks her mind on all manner of subjects. She finds out more about the world beyond her door when she meets Thomas and finds that he will engage her in useful and interesting discussions. [1]
Anne Perry wrote The Cater Street Hangman as a single, stand alone, novel. She had not intended for it to become a series and so there are elements in this book which do not blend smoothly into the series. [1] [2]

Major themes
Journey from Innocence to Awareness
The Inward Struggle â€“ The story is told from within each of the characters. Wives think about husbands, sisters watch one another. Readers witness the various thoughts that crowd into the characters head as each suspects the others and tries to reconcile their treacherous thoughts about those they thought they know and love.
Victorian Society as a Facade
The Love Triangle â€“ Charlotte has been in love with her sister's husband since the day they met. As the book comes to a close this unrequited love divides the Ellison house.
Classism /Oppression of the Poor â€“ As each murder victim is laid to rest their reputation is soiled as they are labelled as having been among bad seeds. This reference to the lower classes makes the upper class feel secure. Also, Thomas and Charlotte have many discussions about the plight of the poor. Charlotte wonders why anyone would choose to live in squalor and Thomas explains what it means to be poor.
Madness â€“ The crimes are blamed upon a mythical madman that no one is able to define. The murderer does turn out to be quite mad, but not in a way that anyone was expecting when they threw the term around earlier in the novel.
