La Planète des singes, known in English as Planet of the Apes or Monkey Planet, is a French 1963 science fiction novel by Pierre Boulle. The novel inspired the Planet of the Apes film franchise. The novel tells the tale of three human explorers from Earth who visit a planet orbiting the star Betelgeuse, in which great apes are the dominant intelligent and civilized species, whereas humans are reduced to a savage animal-like state.
Plot
In the frame story , a frivolous couple sailing alone in space, Jinn and Phyllis, rescue and translate a manuscript from a floating bottle. Journalist Ulysse MÃ©rou has set off for a friendly planet with his family. Single in 2500, he was invited by wealthy Professor Antelle to accompany him and his disciple, physician Arthur Levain to Betelgeuse . From time dilation , centuries pass on Earth for their two years in transit.
At temperate lushly forested Soror ( Latin for sister), they launch a shuttle from the orbiting ship. They can breathe the air, drink the water, and eat the fruit. Attracted by a lovely golden naked woman they call Nova, they swim below a scenic waterfall. Frightened by their chimpanzee Hector, she strangles the pet. Her tribe also gabble speechless, eyes "void" of intelligence, wreck the newcomers' clothing and launch.
Fully dressed gorilla hunters attack, shoot many dead, including Arthur, trap Ulysse with survivors. Ape clothing matches that of modern men, except for gloves on prehensile feet . They smoke, photograph trophies, drink through straws, appear utterly civilized. Their stagnant society is divided into three strata: aggressive gorilla commanders, pedantic unchanging orangutan administrators, and chimp intellectuals. Men are mindless speechless animals.
In an urban biological research facility, Ulysse recognizes Pavlov's dog conditioning and is mated with Nova in the same cage. Luckily, curious chimp researcher Zira takes interest in his geometry drawings and few simian words. With help from her fiancÃ© CornÃ©lius , he makes a speech in front of several thousands, who give him freedom and best of all, tailored clothes. Old Antelle has reverted to bestiality in the zoo, so is moved to the lab for safety, with a young female mate.
But events conspire to threaten. Cornelius digs up an ancient human civilized city. An unconscious lab subject, brain stimulated by electrodes, tells the fall of human civilization in many voices. Ape slaves outnumbered, plotted, and killed or evicted their masters to the wild. Nova bears Ulysse a son Sirius, who precociously walks and talks at three months. In danger of their lives, the family are substituted - all humans look alike - into a space flight experiment, to rendezvous with the still orbiting ship.
Robots fly the ship back to Earth. Paris Orly Airport and the Eiffel Tower look the same, but the officer in the welcoming jeep of two is a gorilla. Jinn and Phyllis refuse to believe Ulysse's impossible story, being civilized chimps.
