Feminism and Religion
The book deals heavily with the intersection of feminism and religion ; more specifically, their combination in the form of the character Margery Childe. When Mary first hears her speak, Margery is discussing a passage from 1 Corinthians in the Christian Bible :
"Women should keep silence in church; for they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as the law says...It is shameful for a woman to speak in church."
Margery's conclusion is that men are afraid of the questions women might ask concerning religion, the bible, and God, and realize that women are not inferior. She points out that the bible describes both men and women being created in God's image - not just males. She dissects the "adam's rib" creation story, noting that humanity was not complete until woman was created. Mary, a theology scholar, mentions to Margery that in the original biblical manuscripts, there are numerous references to God in the feminine; using "She" and "Her" instead of "His and "Him". Mary has learned through her research that these references were removed as the works were translated into other languages, presumably so that God would appear as a wholly masculine being. In an author interview, Laurie R. King is noted to describe herself as a "...feminist-although that basically means I support the right of a woman to get paid for doing the same job as a man, not that I believe men to be inferior or superfluous."
Holmes's Past
There is a mention of Holmes having fathered a son, and to Holmes having gone through a very rough period while his son fought a drug addiction. There are also references to a relationship with Irene Adler .
Reception
In a paper examining the feminist narrative in a contemporary context, Lillian Doherty felt disappointed by the ending, believing Mary failed to "uphold the honour of the feminists" when she needed to be rescued by Holmes. [2]
