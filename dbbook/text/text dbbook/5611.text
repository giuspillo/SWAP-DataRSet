Plot summary
The Morgawr is a centuries-old sorcerer of unimaginable might, who feeds upon the souls of his enemies. With a fleet of airships and a crew of walking dead men at his command, he is in relentless pursuit of the Jerle Shannara . His goal is twofold: to find and control the fabled 'magic' of Parkasia, and to destroy the Ilse Witch (his disciple) to keep her from using the magic to destroy him.
But she has already paid a heavy price for her actions. When Walker Boh persuades the witch to use the Sword of Shannara , she is exposed to its awesome power and forced to confront the truth of her horrifying deeds as the Ilse Witch , causing her to flee deep into her own mind. She has only one protector: her brother Bek, who is determined to redeem her.
He does this, and they use their combined magic to destroy the Morgawr. They go home to the Four Lands. But rather than going home with Bek, Grianne Ohmsford will be going now to Paranor , for Walker charged her with a very important task before he died: she is to foster a new Druid order.
