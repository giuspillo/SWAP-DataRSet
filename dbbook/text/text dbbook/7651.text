Sally Estes, of Booklist reviewed the book saying, "A welcome chance to revisit Moose County for regulars, but don't expect passer-by to stick around. [1] Dave Roy, of Curled Up, reviewed the book saying, "Give The Cat Who Had 60 Whiskers a miss, because it's something the cat hacked up." [2] Marge Fletcher, of Book Reporter reviewed the book saying, "Throughout the book, on the lefthand side of certain new paragraphs, there are drawings of a cat paw. These serve to remind the audience that Koko and Yum Yum are the real stars of the series, as they provide an interesting and creative leitmotif for the reader's enjoyment" [3]
