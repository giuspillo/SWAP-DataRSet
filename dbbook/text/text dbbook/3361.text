The Quick Red Fox (1964) is the fourth novel in the Travis McGee series by John D. MacDonald . In it, McGee is hired to aid a fictitious Hollywood star named Lysa Dean who is being blackmailed with revealing photographs.
A note for future expansion of this article: In Chapter 6, McGee is thinking "Not necessarily Helo'ise and Abelard, Romeo and Miss Capulet, or even Nappi and Joe. But just a crumb of some kind of love there, lad." Nappi and Joe is a reference to Napoleon and Josephine, popular romantic figures at the time, and there was a silent movie with that title, directed by Alexander Butler, in 1924.
