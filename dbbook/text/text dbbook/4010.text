is a 2001 Japanese 206-page melodrama novel, written by Kyoichi Katayama and published by Shogakukan, which revolves around narrator Sakutaro Matsumoto's recollections of a school classmate whom he once loved. It's also known as Crying Out Love, In the Center of the World (世界の中心で、愛をさけぶ, Sekai no Chūshin de, Ai o Sakebu), which author Katayama used after his editors advised that his original novel title Socrates in Love wouldn't work.
Plot summary
In a small town of southern Japan , Sakutaro "Saku" Matsumoto and Aki Hirose, classmates since junior high, become high school students. During this time they begin to date and their conversations circle around the idea of what love really is, beginning after Saku's grandfather shares his own past love story with Saku.
After a trip the two take to an abandoned island, Aki discovers she has leukemia , which limits her chances to go outside or see Saku. Once Saku learns the truth, he buys flight tickets to take Aki to Australia's Uluru (Ayers Rock); a place she had always wanted to visit after missing the school trip there, but she dies before she could board the plane.
The story takes place as a flashback through Saku's eyes as he and Aki's parents travel to Australia to spread Aki's ashes in the place she had always wanted to see.

About the title
Socrates in Love is the English translation of author Katayama's original Japanese title, æ�‹ã�™ã‚‹ã‚½ã‚¯ãƒ©ãƒ†ã‚¹ (Koi Suru Sokuratesu).
The novel and its manga adaptation (illustrated by Kazumi Kazui ) were published in the United States by VIZ Media under the English translated title of author Katayama's original title.
The 2004 film title, Sekai no ChÅ«shin de, Ai o Sakebu, is abbreviated in Japan as SekachÅ« (ã‚»ã‚«ãƒ�ãƒ¥ãƒ¼).
To date, the 2005 Hong Kong DVD release of the 2004 film adaptation is the only English-language release that has its title Crying Out Love, In the Center of the World in English. The 2004 film and the 2004 TV series still haven't been released to the English-language market outside Hong Kong.
Notes about the novel
Katayama had intended Socrates in Love as part of a trilogy [1] to explore the concept and themes of youth and memories. His editors however decided [1] to take advantage of the "Pure Love boom"â€”a Japanese media trend of novels and films that portray a chaste, undying and tragic loveâ€”by publishing the novel under Crying Out Love, In the Center of the World to appeal fans of tragic love stories. In spite of this, only 8,000 copies of the book were printed and distributed, due to the poor sales of Katayama's two previous novels. [1]
A year after the novel's publication, celebrity actress Kou Shibasaki wrote in a guest column for Japanese monthly literary and pop culture magazine Da Vinci (March 2002 issue): "I read it thoroughly even though it made me cry. I wished to have a such relationship in my life." The book became a best-seller, due to Shibasaki's recommendation and the word of mouth. In May 2004 over 3 million copies were sold, surpassing the sales record of Haruki Murakami's Norwegian Wood . Shibasaki subsequently appeared in the 2004 film version.
