"I agree with Mr. Bragan and Mr. Ferris. Americans do not fight even for millions with clubs. " I could have named him an American who had used a blackjack on a fellow citizen to relieve him of $2.38, but of course he wasn't an oil tycoon. — Archie, commenting on an ambassador's naïveté, in "Immune to Murder", chapter 4
" Too Many Detectives ", first published September 14, 1956, in Collier's

The far less valuable Viking book club edition may be distinguished from the first edition in three ways:
The dust jacket has "Book Club Edition" printed on the inside front flap, and the price is absent (first editions may be price clipped if they were given as gifts).
Book club editions are sometimes thinner and always taller (usually a quarter of an inch) than first editions.
Book club editions are bound in cardboard, and first editions are bound in cloth (or have at least a cloth spine). [5]
