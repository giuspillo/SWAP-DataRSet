Lion of Ireland, by the American-Irish author Morgan Llywelyn , is a novel about the life of the Irish hero and High King Brian Boru .
The story begins with Brian as a child of around 8 or 9 and it ends with him as an 88 year old man. The book shows his rise to power and his struggle to maintain it. His personal life is an important part of the plot, because Brian's war against MÃ¡el MÃ³rda (leader of the Leinstermen) and Sihtric (king of Dublin) was to be inextricably connected with his complicated marital relations, in particular his marriage to Gormlaith, MÃ¡el MÃ³rda's sister and Sihtric's mother, who had been in turn the wife of AmlaÃ­b CuarÃ¡n, king of Dublin and York, then of MÃ¡el Sechnaill. Even though the book is based on a historical figure, most of it is fiction.
Movie adaptation
In 2003, out of business, Ireland based, RiverFilms proposed a film adaptation of the book as Braveheart and El Cid meet The Vikings. [1]
