Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel by Ray Bradbury. The novel presents a future American society where books are outlawed and firemen burn any house that contains them. This novel has been the subject of various interpretations, primarily focusing on the historical role of book burning in suppressing dissenting ideas. In a 1956 radio interview, Bradbury stated that he wrote Fahrenheit 451 because of his concerns at the time about censorship and the threat of book burning in the United States. In later years, he stated his motivation for writing the book in more general terms. Fran√ßois Truffaut wrote and directed a film adaptation of the novel in 1966. At least two BBC Radio 4 dramatisations have also been aired, both of which follow the book very closely. The book's title refers to the temperature that Bradbury understood to be the autoignition point of book paper. A prequel/companion exists titled A Pleasure To Burn, and a video game sequel exists as well, also titled Fahrenheit 451.

Plot summary
Fahrenheit 451 is set in an unspecified city (likely in the American Mid-West ) at some unspecified time in the future [notes 1] after the year 1960. [notes 2] [15]
The novel is divided into three parts: "The Hearth and the Salamander", "The Sieve and the Sand", and "Burning Bright".
The Hearth and the Salamander
Guy Montag is a "fireman" hired to burn the possessions of those who read outlawed books. One fall night while returning from work, he meets his new neighbor: a teenage girl named Clarisse McClellan, whose free-thinking ideals and liberating spirit cause him to question his life and his own perceived happiness. Montag returns home to find that his wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills, and calls for medical attention. Since pill overdoses have become commonplace, two stomach pump operators are hired to do the job instead of an MD. Mildred survives with no memory of what happened, even when Montag tells her the truth after believing she drank too much at a house party. Over the next days, Clarisse faithfully meets Montag as he walks home. She tells him about how her interests have made her an outcast at school and with her own peers, who would rather engage in violent, self-destructive behavior than be like Clarisse. Montag looks forward to these meetings, and just as he begins to expect them, Clarisse goes absent. He senses something is wrong. [16]
In the following days, while at work with the other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and burn herself alive . Montag returns home jarred by the woman's suicide. While getting ready for bed, he hides the stolen book under his pillow. Still shaken by the night's events, Montag attempts to make conversation with Mildred, conversation that only cements the fact that he and Mildred are strangers in a cold, loveless marriage with nothing in common and no memory of how they even met for the first time. After thinking back to the first time he and Mildred watched a program on the parlor walls (an experience that shook Montag because of how loud and intense the program was), Montag asks his wife if she has seen Clarisse recently. Mildred mutters that Clarisse was hit by a speeding car four days ago and her family moved away. Montag is shocked to discover this, and dismayed that his wife didn't tell him sooner. As Montag tries to fall asleep, he senses "The Hound", an eight-legged [17] robotic dog -like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen.
Montag wakes up ill the next morning and decides to stay home, despite his wife's protests. He relates the story of the burned woman to an apathetic Mildred and suggests that he quit his job for a while, perhaps permanently. Mildred yells at Montag, stating that if he quit, they'd lose the house (and, for Mildred, it would be the end of being entertained by her "family" on the parlor walls) and blames the woman Montag burned for warping his mind.
Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: Over the course of several decades, people embraced new media, sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged and degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content found in books. The government took advantage of this and the firemen were soon hired to burn books in the name of public happiness. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.
After Beatty has left, Montag reveals to Mildred that over the last year he has accumulated a stash of books that he has kept hidden in their air-conditioning duct . In a panic, Mildred grabs a book and rushes to throw it in their kitchen incinerator; Montag subdues her and tells her that the two of them are going to read the books to see if they have value. If they do not, he promises the books will be burned and all will return to normal.
The Sieve and the Sand
While Montag and Mildred are perusing the stolen books, a sniffing occurs at their front door. Montag recognizes it as The Hound while Mildred passes it off as a random dog. They resume their discussion once the sound ceases, but Mildred refuses to go along with this any further, commenting on how worthless books are. Montag counters by telling Mildred about her suicide attempt, the woman who burned herself, Clarisse's disappearance, and the constant din of bombers flying over their house taking part in a looming war neither he nor anyone else knows about in full detail. He states that maybe the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction. The conversation is interrupted by a call from Mildred's friend Ann (Bowles), and they set up a date to watch the "parlor walls" (large televisions lining the walls of her living room) that night at Mildred's house.
Montag laments that his wife is a lost cause and he will be too if he doesn't find outside help. Montag remembers an old man named Faber he once met in a park a year ago, an English professor before books were banned. He telephones Faber with questions about books and Faber soon hangs up on him. Undeterred, Montag makes a subway trip to Faber's home along with a rare copy of the Bible, the book he stole at the woman's house. He tries to memorize it on the way there, but is bombarded with a jingle for Denham's Dentifrice and nearly causes a panic among the passengers. Montag forces the scarred and reluctant Faber into helping him by methodically ripping pages from the Bible. Faber concedes and gives Montag a homemade ear-piece communicator so he can offer constant guidance.
After Montag returns home, Mildred's friends, Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. (Clara) Phelps, arrive to watch the parlor walls. Not interested in the insipid entertainment they are watching, Montag turns off the walls and tries to engage the women in meaningful conversation, only to find them indifferent to all but the most trivial aspects of the upcoming war, their families, and politics. Montag leaves momentarily and returns with a book of poetry. This confuses the women and alarms Faber who is listening remotely. Mildred assures her friends that each year, the firemen take home a book to mock in front of company. He proceeds to recite the poem Dover Beach , causing Mrs. Phelps to cry. At the behest of Faber in the ear-piece, Montag burns the book. Mildred's friends leave in tears and disgust while Mildred locks herself in the bathroom and takes more sleeping pills.
In the aftermath of the parlor party, Montag hides his books in his backyard before returning to the firehouse late at night with just the stolen Bible. He finds Beatty playing cards with the other firemen. Montag hands him the book, which is unceremoniously tossed into the trash. Beatty tells Montag that he had a dream in which they fought endlessly by quoting books to each other. In describing the dream Beatty reveals that, despite his disillusionment, he was once an enthusiastic reader. A fire alarm sounds and Beatty picks up the address from the dispatcher system. They drive in the firetruck recklessly to the destination. Montag is stunned when the truck pulls up to his house.
Burning Bright
Beatty orders Montag to destroy his own house, telling him that his wife and her friends were the ones who reported him. Montag tries to talk to Mildred as she quickly leaves the house. Mildred ignores him, gets inside a taxi, and vanishes down the street. Montag obeys the chief, destroying the home piece by piece with a flamethrower . As soon as he has incinerated the house, Beatty discovers Montag's ear-piece and plans to hunt down Faber. Montag threatens Beatty with the flamethrower and (after Beatty taunts him) burns his boss alive, and knocks his coworkers unconscious. As Montag escapes the scene, the firehouse's mechanical dog attacks him, managing to inject his leg with a tranquilizer. He destroys it with the flamethrower and limps away.
Montag runs through the city streets towards Faber's house. Faber urges him to make his way to the countryside and contact the exiled book-lovers who live there. He mentions he will be leaving on an early bus heading to St. Louis and that he and Montag can rendezvous there later. On Faber's television, they watch news reports of another mechanical hound being released, with news helicopters following it to create a public spectacle. Montag leaves Faber's house. After an extended manhunt, he escapes by wading into a river and floating downstream.
Montag leaves the river in the countryside, where he meets the exiled drifters, lead by a man named Granger. They have each memorized books for an upcoming time when society is ready to rediscover them. While learning the philosophy of the exiles, Montag and the group watch helplessly as bombers fly overhead and attack the city with nuclear weapons , completely annihilating it . While Faber would have left on the early bus, Mildred along with everyone else in the city was surely killed. Montag and the group are injured and dirtied and survive the shock wave.
In the morning after, Granger teaches Montag and the others about the legendary phoenix and its endless cycle of long life, death in flames, and rebirth. He adds that the phoenix must have some relation to mankind, which constantly repeats its mistakes. Granger emphasizes that man has something the phoenix does not: mankind can remember the mistakes it made from before it destroyed itself, and try to not make them again. Granger then muses that a large factory of mirrors should be built, so that mankind can take a long look at itself. When the meal is over, the band goes back toward the city, to help rebuild society.
Characters
Guy Montag is the protagonist and fireman who presents the dystopia through the eyes of a worker loyal to it, a man in conflict about it, and one resolved to be free of it. Through most of the book, Montag lacks knowledge and believes what he hears.
Clarisse McClellan walks with Montag on his trips home and is one month short of being a 17-year-old girl. [notes 3] [18] She is an unusual sort of person in the bookless, hedonistic society: outgoing, naturally cheerful, unorthodox, and intuitive. She is unpopular among peers and disliked by teachers for asking "why" instead of "how" and focusing on nature rather than on technology. A few days after their first meeting, she disappears without any explanation; Mildred tells Montag (and Captain Beatty confirms) that Clarisse was hit by a speeding car and that her family left following her death. In the afterword of a later edition, Bradbury notes that the film adaptation changed the ending so that Clarisse (who, in the film, is now a 20-year-old school teacher who was fired for being unorthodox) was living with the exiles. Bradbury, far from being displeased by this, was so happy with the new ending that he wrote it into his later stage edition.
Mildred "Millie" Montag is Guy Montag's wife. She is addicted to sleeping pills, absorbed in the shallow dramas played on her "parlor walls" (flat-panel televisions), and indifferent to the oppressive society around her. She is described as "thin as a praying mantis from dieting, her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw...and her flesh like white bacon." Despite her husband's attempts to break her from the spell society has on her, Mildred continues to be shallow and indifferent. After Montag scares her friends away by reading Dover Beach and unable to live with someone who has been hoarding books, Mildred betrays Montag by reporting him to the firemen and abandoning him.
Captain Beatty is Montag's boss. Once an avid reader, he has come to hate books due to their unpleasant content and contradicting facts and opinions. In a scene written years later by Bradbury for the Fahrenheit 451 play, Beatty invites Montag to his house where he shows him walls of books left to molder on their shelves.
Stoneman and Black are Montag's coworkers at the firehouse. They do not have a large impact on the story and function to show the reader the contrast between the firemen who obediently do as they're told and someone like Montag, who formerly took pride in his job, only to realize how damaging it is to society.
Faber is a former English professor. He has spent years regretting that he did not defend books when he saw the moves to ban them. Montag turns to him for guidance, remembering him from a chance meeting in a park some time earlier. Faber at first refuses to help Montag, and later realizes that he is only trying to learn about books, not destroy them. Bradbury notes in his afterword that Faber is part of the name of a German manufacturer of pencils, Faber-Castell .
Mrs. Ann Bowles and Mrs. Clara Phelps are Mildred's friends and representative of the anti-intellectual, hedonistic society presented in the novel. During a social visit to Montag's house, they brag about ignoring the bad things in their lives and have a cavalier attitude towards the upcoming war, their husbands, their children, and politics. Mrs. Phelps has a husband named Pete who was called in to fight in the upcoming war (and believes that he'll be back in a week because of how quick the war will be) and thinks having children serves no purpose other than to ruin lives. Mrs. Bowles is a thrice married, single mother. Her first husband divorced her, her second died in a jet accident, and her third committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. She has two children who do not like or even respect her due to her permissive, often negligent and abusive parenting: Mrs. Bowles brags that her kids beat her up and she's glad that she can fight back. When Montag reads Dover Beach to them, Mrs. Phelps starts crying over how hollow her life is while Mrs. Bowles chastises Montag for reading "silly awful hurting words".
Granger is the leader of a group of wandering intellectual exiles who memorize books in order to preserve their contents.
Historical context
Bradbury's lifelong passion with books began at an early age. As a frequent visitor to his local libraries in the 1920s and 1930s, he recalls being disappointed because they did not stock popular science fiction novels, like those of H. G. Wells , because, at the time, they were not deemed literary enough. Between this and learning about the destruction of the Library of Alexandria , [19] a great impression was made on the young man about the vulnerability of books to censure and destruction. Later as a teenager, Bradbury was horrified by the Nazi book burnings and later Joseph Stalin 's campaign of political repression, the " Great Purge ", in which writers and poets, among many others, were arrested and often executed. [20]

After the 1945 conclusion of World War II shortly after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the United States focused its concern on the Soviet atomic bomb project and the expansion of communism. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùformed in 1938 to investigate American citizens and organizations suspected of having communist ties√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùheld hearings in 1947 to investigate alleged communist influence in Hollywood movie-making. These hearings resulted in the blacklisting of the so-called " Hollywood Ten ", [21] a group of influential screenwriters and directors. This governmental interference in the affairs of artists and creative types greatly angered Bradbury. [22] Bitter and concerned about the workings of his government, a late 1949 nighttime encounter with an overzealous police officer would inspire Bradbury to write "The Pedestrian", a short story which would go on to become "The Fireman" and then Fahrenheit 451. The rise of Senator Joseph McCarthy 's hearings hostile to accused communists starting in 1950, would only deepen Bradbury's contempt over government overreach.[ citation needed ]
The same year HUAC began investigating Hollywood is often considered the beginning of the Cold War , as in March 1947, the Truman Doctrine was announced. By about 1950, the Cold War was in full swing and the American public's fear of atomic warfare and communist influence was at a feverish level. The stage was set for Bradbury to write the dramatic nuclear holocaust ending of Fahrenheit 451, exemplifying the type of scenario feared by many Americans of the time.[ citation needed ]
Bradbury's early life witnessed the Golden Age of Radio while the transition to the Golden Age of Television began right around the time he started to work on the stories that would eventually lead to Fahrenheit 451. Bradbury saw these forms of media as a threat to the reading of books, indeed as a threat to society, because they can act as a distraction from important affairs. This contempt for mass media would express itself through Mildred and her friends and is an important theme in the book.[ citation needed ]
Writing and development
Fahrenheit 451 developed out of a series of ideas Bradbury had visited in previously written stories. For many years, he tended to single out " The Pedestrian " in interviews and lectures as sort of a proto-Fahrenheit 451. In the Preface of his 2006 anthology Match to Flame: The Fictional Paths to Fahrenheit 451 he states that this is an oversimplification. [23] The full genealogy of Fahrenheit 451 given in Match to Flame is involved. The following covers the most salient aspects.[ citation needed ]
Between 1947 and 1948, [24] Bradbury wrote the short story "Bright Phoenix" (not published until the May 1963 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction [25] [26] ) about a librarian who confronts a book-burning "Chief Censor" named Jonathan Barnes. Barnes is a clear foreshadow of the ominous Captain Beatty of Fahrenheit 451.[ citation needed ]
In late 1949, [27] Bradbury was stopped and questioned by a police officer while walking late one night. [28] [29] When asked "What are you doing?", Bradbury wisecracked, "Putting one foot in front of another." [28] [29] This incident inspired Bradbury to write the 1951 short story "The Pedestrian". [notes 4] [28] [29] In "The Pedestrian", Leonard Mead is harassed and detained by the city's remotely-operated police cruiser (there's only one) for taking nighttime walks, something that has become extremely rare in this future-based setting: everybody else stays inside and watches television ("viewing screens"). Alone and without an alibi , Mead is taken to the "Psychiatric Center for Research on Regressive Tendencies" for his peculiar habit. Fahrenheit 451 would later echo this theme of an authoritarian society distracted by broadcast media .[ citation needed ]
Bradbury expanded the book-burning premise of "Bright Phoenix" [30] and the totalitarian future of "The Pedestrian" [31] into "The Fireman", a novella published in the February 1951 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction . [32] [33] "The Fireman" was written in the basement of UCLA 's Powell Library on a typewriter that he rented for a fee of ten cents per half hour. [34] The first draft was 25,000 words long and was completed in nine days. [35]
Urged by a publisher at Ballantine Books to double the length of his story to make a novel, Bradbury returned to the same typing room and expanded his work into Fahrenheit 451, taking just nine days. [34] The completed book was published by Ballantine in 1953.[ citation needed ]
Supplementary material
Bradbury has supplemented the novel with various front and back matter , including a 1979 coda, a 1982 afterword , a 1993 foreword , and several introductions . In these he provides some commentary on the themes of the novel, thoughts on the movie adaptation, and numerous personal anecdotes related to the writing and development.[ citation needed ]
Publication history
The first U.S. printing was a paperback version from October 1953 by The Ballantine Publishing Group. Shortly after the paperback, a hardback version was released that included a special edition of 200 signed and numbered copies bound in asbestos. [36] [37] These were technically collections because the novel was published with two short stories: "The Playground" and "And the Rock Cried Out", which have been absent in later printings. [1] [38] A few months later, the novel was serialized in the March, April, and May 1954 issues of nascent Playboy magazine. [8] [39]
In January 1967, the Revised Bal-Hi Edition was printed and in March 1967, the Special Book Club Edition was printed. The first Canadian printing was in October 1963 and the seventh printing was in October 1972. [40] The second U.S. printing was in April 1991.[ citation needed ]
An audiobook version read by Bradbury himself was released in 1976 and received a Spoken Word Grammy nomination . [13] Another audiobook was released in 2005 narrated by Christopher Hurt. [41] The e-book version was released in December 2011. [42] [43]
Expurgation
Fahrenheit 451 was subject to expurgation by its publisher, Ballantine Books , beginning in 1967. [44] Among the changes made by the publisher were the censorship of the words "hell", "damn", and "abortion"; the modification of seventy-five passages; and the changing of two episodes. [44] In the one case, a drunk man became a "sick man" while cleaning fluff out of a human navel became "cleaning ears" in the other. [44] [45] For a while both the censored and uncensored versions were available concurrently but by 1973 Ballantine was publishing only the censored version. [45] [46] This continued until 1979 when it came to Bradbury's attention: [45] [46]
In 1979, one of Bradbury's friends showed him an expurgated copy. Bradbury demanded that Ballantine Books withdraw that version and replace it with the original, and in 1980 the original version once again became available. In this reinstated work, in the Author's Afterword, Bradbury relates to the reader that it is not uncommon for a publisher to expurgate an author's work, but he asserts that he himself will not tolerate the practice of manuscript "mutilation".
Reception
In 1954, Galaxy Science Fiction reviewer Groff Conklin placed the novel "among the great works of the imagination written in English in the last decade or more." [47] The Chicago Sunday Tribune 's August Derleth described the book as "a savage and shockingly savage prophetic view of one possible future way of life," calling it "compelling" and praising Bradbury for his "brilliant imagination". [48] Over half a century later, Sam Weller wrote, "upon its publication, Fahrenheit 451 was hailed as a visionary work of social commentary." [49] Today, Fahrenheit 451 is still viewed as an important cautionary tale against conformity and book burning . [50]
When the book was first published there were those who did not find merit in the tale. Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas were less enthusiastic, faulting the book for being "simply padded, occasionally with startlingly ingenious gimmickry,¬†... often with coruscating cascades of verbal brilliance [but] too often merely with words." [51] Reviewing the book for Astounding Science Fiction , P. Schuyler Miller characterized the title piece as "one of Bradbury's bitter, almost hysterical diatribes," and praised its "emotional drive and compelling, nagging detail." [52] Similarly, The New York Times was unimpressed with the novel and further accused Bradbury of developing a "virulent hatred for many aspects of present-day culture, namely, such monstrosities as radio, TV, most movies, amateur and professional sports, automobiles, and other similar aberrations which he feels debase the bright simplicity of the thinking man's existence." [53]
Censorship/banning incidents
Ironic attempts to censor or ban Fahrenheit 451 occur from time to time. The following are some notable incidents:
In 1987, Fahrenheit 451 was given "third tier" status by the Bay County School Board in Panama City, Florida , under then-superintendent Leonard Hall's new three-tier classification system. [54] Third tier was meant for books to be removed from the classroom for "a lot of vulgarity". [54] After a resident class-action lawsuit, a media stir, and student protests, the school board abandoned their tier-based censorship system and approved all the currently used books. [54]
In 1992, Irvine, California 's Venado Middle School gave copies of Fahrenheit 451 to students with all "obscene" words blacked out. [55] Parents contacted the local media and succeeded in reinstalling the uncensored copies. [55]
In 2006, parents of a tenth grade high school student in Montgomery County, Texas , demanded the book be banned from their daughter's English class reading list. [56] Their daughter was assigned the book during Banned Books Week , but stopped reading several pages in due to the offensive language and description of the burning of the Bible . [56] In addition, her parents protested the violence, portrayal of Christians, and depictions of firemen in the novel. [56]
Themes
Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often center on its story foremost as a warning against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era , he was concerned about censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, [7] [57] Bradbury said:
I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows, there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.[ citation needed ]
As time went by, Bradbury tended to dismiss censorship as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually claimed that the real messages of Fahrenheit 451 were about the dangers of an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recounted:
In writing the short novel Fahrenheit 451 I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction. [58]
This story echoes Mildred's "Seashell ear-thimbles" (i.e., a brand of in-ear headphones) that act as an emotional barrier between her and Montag. In a 2007 interview, Bradbury maintained that people misinterpret his book and that Fahrenheit 451 is really a statement on how mass media like television marginalizes the reading of literature. [59] Regarding minorities, he wrote in his 1979 Coda:
There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority, be it Baptist / Unitarian, Irish / Italian / Octogenarian / Zen Buddhist / Zionist / Seventh-day Adventist / Women's Lib / Republican / Mattachine / FourSquareGospel feels it has the will, the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse¬†... Fire-Captain Beatty, in my novel Fahrenheit 451, described how the books were burned first by the minorities, each ripping a page or a paragraph from this book, then that, until the day came when the books were empty and the minds shut and the library closed forever. Only six weeks ago, I discovered that, over the years, some cubby-hole editors at Ballantine Books, fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some 75 separate sections from the novel. Students, reading the novel which, after all, deals with the censorship and book-burning in the future, wrote to tell me of this exquisite irony. Judy-Lynn del Rey, one of the new Ballantine editors, is having the entire book reset and republished this summer with all the damns and hells back in place. [60]
Book-burning censorship, Bradbury would argue, was a side-effect of the these two primary factors; this is consistent with Captain Beatty's speech to Montag about the history of the firemen. According to Bradbury, it is the people, not the state, who are the culprit in Fahrenheit 451. [59] Nevertheless, the role on censorship, state-based or otherwise, is still perhaps the most frequent theme explored in the work.[ citation needed ]
A variety of other themes in the novel besides censorship have been suggested. Two major themes are resistance to conformity and control of individuals via technology and mass media. Bradbury explores how the government is able to use mass media to influence society and suppress individualism through book burning. The characters Beatty and Faber point out the American population is to blame. Due to their constant desire for a simplistic, positive image, books must be suppressed. Beatty blames the minority groups, who would take offense to published works that displayed them in an unfavorable light. Faber went further to state that the American population simply stopped reading on their own. He notes that the book burnings themselves became a form of entertainment to the general public. [61] Others have written on themes like the metamorphosis of the individual and the importance of wilderness.[ citation needed ]
Predictions for the future
Bradbury describes himself as "a preventor of futures, not a predictor of them." [62] He did not believe that book burning was an inevitable part of our future, he wanted to warn against its development. [62] In a later interview, when asked if he believes that teaching Fahrenheit 451 in schools will prevent his totalitarian [2] vision of the future, Bradbury replied in the negative. Rather, he states that education must be at the kindergarten and first-grade level. If students are unable to read then, they will be unable to read Fahrenheit 451. [63]
In terms of technology, Sam Weller notes that Bradbury "predicted everything from flat-panel televisions to iPod earbuds and twenty-four-hour banking machines." [64]
Adaptations
Playhouse 90 broadcast "A Sound of Different Drummers" on CBS in 1957, written by Robert Alan Aurthur . The play combined plot ideas from Fahrenheit 451 and Nineteen Eighty-Four . Bradbury sued and eventually won on appeal. [65] [66]
A film adaptation written and directed by Fran√É¬ßois Truffaut and starring Oskar Werner and Julie Christie was released in 1966. [67] [ unreliable source? ]
BBC Radio produced a one-off dramatization of the novel in 1982 [68] starring Michael Pennington . [69] It was broadcast again on February 12, 2012, and April 7 and 8, 2013, on BBC Radio 4 Extra . [70]
In 2006, the Drama Desk Award winning Godlight Theatre Company produced and performed the New York City premiere of Ray Bradbury 's Fahrenheit 451 at 59E59 Theaters . [72] After the completion of the New York run, the production then transferred to the Edinburgh Festival where it was a 2006 Edinburgh Festival Pick of the Fringe. [73]
The Off-Broadway theatre The American Place Theatre presented a one man show adaptation of Fahrenheit 451 as a part of their 2008√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú2009 Literature to Life season. [74]
In June 2009, a graphic novel edition of the book was published. Entitled Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451: The Authorized Adaptation, [75] the paperback graphic adaptation was illustrated by Tim Hamilton . The introduction in the novel is written by Bradbury.[ citation needed ]
Fahrenheit 451 inspired the Birmingham Repertory Theatre production "Time Has Fallen Asleep in the Afternoon Sunshine", which was performed at the Birmingham Central Library in April 2012. [76]
Notes
^ During Captain Beatty's recounting of the history of the firemen to Montag, he says, "Out of the nursery into the college and back to the nursery; there's your intellectual pattern for the past five centuries or more." The text is ambiguous regarding which century he is claiming began this pattern. One interpretation is that he means the 20th century, which would place the novel in at least the 24th century. "The Fireman" novella, which was expanded to become Fahrenheit 451, is set in October 2052.
^ In early editions of the book, Montag says, "We've started and won two atomic wars since 1960" in the first pages of The Sieve and the Sand. This sets a lower bound on the time setting. In later decades, some editions have changed this year to 1990 or 2022.
^ Clarisse tells Montag she is "seventeen and crazy", later admitting that she will actually be seventeen "next month".
