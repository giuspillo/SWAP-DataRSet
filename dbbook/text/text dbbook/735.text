Eberron Campaign Setting is a hardcover accessory for the 3.5 edition of the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game.
Reception
The reviewer from Pyramid commented: "If you're one of the thousands who submitted a one-page treatment for Wizards of the Coast's world-setting competition, you may want to go ahead and skip this review. But if you're still here: Eberron, the winning entry in the $100,000 contest to select a new world for Dungeons & Dragons fans to play in, is the winner in more ways than one." [2]
