Archform: Beauty is a science fiction novel by L. E. Modesitt published in 2002.
Reception
Roland Green in his review for Booklist said that "Modesitt creates exceptionally vivid but the narrative continuum somewhat hard to get into. Ultimately most readers will probably be absorbed in the book and glad that the ending doesn't preclude further stories in its setting". [1] Kirkus Reviews said that "Modesitt's always worth reading, but this may well be his best ever." [2] Peter Cannon in his review for Publishers Weekly said that "set against a background of biological terrorism, Modesitt's tale explores social issues (only the rich can afford privacy as well as injections of microscopic, medical robots to stay healthy) sure to resonate with many readers. This brilliant novel is as thought provoking as it is entertaining." [3]
