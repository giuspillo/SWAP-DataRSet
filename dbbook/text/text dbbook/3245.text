Analysis
The extended story from We Were Out of Our Minds with Joy, happening in 2092-4, occupies the first part of the novel. The other two parts are set 40 years later, in 2134.
Though the novel is a murder/espionage mystery, the main thrust is the evocation of a world in which the individual is essentially obsolete due to automation.
