He's Just Not That Into You is a self-improvement book written by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo that was published in 2004 and later adapted into a film by the same name in 2009. It was a New York Times bestseller and was featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show.
Inspiration
The book was inspired by an episode of Sex and the City titled "Pick-A-Little, Talk-A-Little", in which Miranda Hobbes asks Carrie Bradshaw 's boyfriend, Jack Berger , to analyze the post-date behavior of a potential love interest. Because the man declined Miranda's invitation to come up to her apartment after the date, stating that he has an early meeting, Berger concludes, "He's just not that into you", adding, "When a guy's really into you, he's coming upstairs, meeting or no meeting."
Synopsis of the Book
The book is a new-aged, unique "self-help" guide aimed for single women. The premise of the book, as stated in the title, tells women readers that if a man in whom you are interested in is not making the effort to pursue you, he is simply "just not that into you."
