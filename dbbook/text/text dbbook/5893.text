Reviews
Reviews for the book were mixed. Publishing industry trade magazines were generally negative. Publishers Weekly wrote "it's hard to get past the novel's many graceless shortcomings, cliched language [...], cartoonish scenes and a protagonist whose superhero character desperately needs fleshing out." [2] A reviewer for Kirkus Reviews called Thor's prose "tangled" at times. [1] [3]
Other media, notably regional titles, were more positive. The Anniston Star wrote that Thor had recreated "a genre that has been firmly in the grasp of Tom Clancy for so long is not an easy feat. Fortunately for military intrigue devotees, Brad Thor has done just that â€” and on his first time out too." The Tacoma Reporter wrote "this book is one of the best entries into the military thriller genre since the early works of Tom Clancy" and that Harvath "will definitely take a place beside Cussler's Dirk Pitt and Clancy's Jack Ryan."
