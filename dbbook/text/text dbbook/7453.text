The Undomestic Goddess is Sophie Kinsella's second "stand-alone" novel, published by Dial Press Trade Paperback on April 2006 (UK).
Plot
Workaholic attorney Samantha Sweeting has just done the unthinkable: sheâ€™s made a mistake. A mistake so huge, itâ€™ll wreck any chance of a partnership.
Going into utter meltdown, she walks out of her London office, gets on a train, and ends up in the middle of nowhere. Asking for directions at a big, beautiful house, sheâ€™s mistaken for an interviewee and finds herself being offered a job as housekeeper. Her employers have no idea theyâ€™ve hired a lawyer â€“ and Samantha has no idea how to work the oven. She canâ€™t sew on a button, bake a potato, or get the ironing board to open. How she takes a deep breath and begins to cope â€“ and finds love â€“ is a story as delicious as the bread she learns to bake. [1]
