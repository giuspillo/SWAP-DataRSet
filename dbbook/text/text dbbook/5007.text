The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea ( Japanese : å�ˆå¾Œã�®æ›³èˆª, meaning The Afternoon Towing), is a novel written by Yukio Mishima , published in Japanese in 1963 and translated into English by John Nathan in 1965.
Plot
The novel chronicles the story of Ryuji, a sailor with vague notions of a special honor awaiting him at sea. He meets a woman called Fusako with whom he falls deeply in love, and he ultimately decides to marry her. Fusako's 13-year-old son, Noboru, is in a band of savage boys who believe in "objectivity," rejecting the adult world as illusory, hypocritical, and sentimental.
As Ryuji begins to draw close to Fusako, a woman of the shore, he is eventually torn away from the dreams he's pursued his entire life. Noboru, who shares an especially close bond with his mother through a voyeuristic ritual, hates the idea of losing his mother to a man who has let his hope and freedom die. This anger and fear of loneliness translates into terrible, savage acts performed by Noboru and the gang of which he is a part.
The novel was adapted into the film The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea starring Kris Kristofferson and Sarah Miles in 1976 by Lewis John Carlino . The setting was changed from Japan to England .
An opera by Hans Werner Henze , Das verratene Meer , is based on the novel; it was premiered in Berlin in 1990. The reception was not good, since a revised version, betitled Goko no Eiko written by Henze under the initiative of the maestro conductor Gerd Albrecht, was adapted to a Japanese libretto close to Mishimas original. The world premiere at Salzburger Festspiele 2005 is released on the label Orfeo, unfortunately without any libretto included.
