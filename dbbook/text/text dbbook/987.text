Modern weaponry and its impact
This section is again a collection of a series of editorials published in the daily newspaper Pratyaksha between 29 July 2006 to 10 August 2006.
This section describes the various kinds of modern destructive weapons, their impact and long term effects on mankind. It also spells out the preventive measures that any ordinary person should take in the event of outbreak of war.
In particular, this section deals with:
Production & use of weaponry by countries such as Israel , United States , Britain , China and France
Techniques of war that the common people need to know.
The author has concluded with an observation on the global efforts that could possibly help avoid the Third World War with a caveat that though these efforts may not be sufficient to completely prevent the war, they will definitely reduce the intensity of its consequences.
