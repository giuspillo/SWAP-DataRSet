Plot summary
Beneath the Wheel is the story of Hans Giebenrath, a talented boy sent to a seminary in Maulbronn . However, his education is focused solely on increasing his knowledge and neglects his development as a person. His close friendship with Hermann Heilner, a less hard-working and more liberal fellow student, is a source of comfort for Hans. In the end, Heilner is expelled from the seminary and Giebenrath is sent home after his performance decreases when he shows symptoms of mental illness. [2]
Back home, he finds coping with his situation difficult, as he has lost most of his childhood to scholastic study and thus never had time to form lasting personal relationships with anyone in his village. He is apprenticed as a blacksmith and seems to enjoy the work; it is visceral and concrete, as opposed to the intellectual abstraction of scholarly work. However, he never fully adjusts to his new situation. On a pub crawl in a neighbouring village, he and his colleagues get drunk. Giebenrath leaves the group to walk home early. Later, he is found to have drowned in a river.
