Dallas instantly recognises this as the work of a man named David Palmer, a serial killer, who Dallas had thrown in prison. Palmer was infamous for kidnapping women, and performing "experiments" on them, before strangling them. He was eventually captured by Dallas, and all of the people on his list are people who helped put him in prison. On December the 19, Palmer escaped, and neither Dallas, nor her commander were aware.
Soon, two more people are dead, and Palmer has kidnapped Dr. Mira. Dallas must find Palmer, before he tires of Mira, and decides to end his experiment.
