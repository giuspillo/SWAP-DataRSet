Five Children and It is a children's novel by English author Edith Nesbit, first published in 1902; it was expanded from a series of stories published in the Strand Magazine in 1900 under the general title The Psammead, or the Gifts. It is the first of a trilogy which includes The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904) and The Story of the Amulet (1906). The book has never been out of print since its initial publication.
Plot summary
Like Nesbit's Railway Children , the story begins when a group of children move from London to the countryside of Kent . While playing in a gravel pit , the five childrenâ€”Robert, Anthea, Cyril, Jane, and their baby brother, the Lambâ€”uncover a rather grumpy, ugly and occasionally malevolent sand- fairy known as the Psammead, who has the ability to grant wishes. However, the Psammead has been buried for so long, he is no longer able to grant individual wishes. Instead, he persuades the children to take one wish per day, to share amongst the lot of them, with the caveat that the wishes will turn to stone at sundown. This, apparently, used to be the rule in the Stone Age , when all children wished for was food, the bones of which would then become fossils . However, when the children's first wishâ€”to be "as beautiful as the day"â€”ends at sundown, it simply vanishes, leading the Psammead to observe that some wishes are too fanciful to be changed to stone.
All the wishes go comically wrong. When the children wish to be beautiful, the servants don't recognise them and shut them out of the house. When they wish to be rich, they find themselves with a gravel-pit full of gold spade guineas that no shop will accept as it is no longer in circulation , so they can't buy anything. A wish for wings seems to be going well, but at sunset the children find themselves stuck atop a church bell tower with no way down, getting them into trouble with the gamekeeper who must take them home (though this wish has the happy side-effect of introducing the gamekeeper to the children's housemaid, who later marries him). After being bullied by the baker's boy, Robert wishes that he was bigger, whereupon he becomes eleven feet tall and the children show him at a travelling fair for coins. They also wish themselves into a castle, only to learn it's being besieged , while a wish to meet real Red Indians ends with the children nearly being scalped .
Even the children's infant brother, the Lamb, is the victim of two wishes gone awry. In one, the children become annoyed with tending for their brother and wish that someone else wanted himâ€”leading to a situation where everyone wants the baby, and the children must fend off kidnappers and Gypsies . Later, they wish the baby would grow up faster, causing him to grow all at once into a selfish, smug young man who promptly leaves them all behind.
Finally, the children accidentally wish they could give a wealthy woman's jewellery to their mother, causing all the jewellery to appear in their home. When it seems that the gamekeeperâ€”who is now their friendâ€”will be blamed for robbery, the children must beg the Psammead for a complex series of wishes to set things right. It agrees, on the condition that they will never ask It, himself, for another wish. Only Anthea, who has grown close to It, makes sure that the final wish is that they will meet It again. The Psammead assures them that this wish will be granted.
The five children, brothers and sisters, are:
Cyril â€“ known as Squirrel
Anthea â€“ known as Panther
Robert â€“ known as Bobs
Jane â€“ known as Pussy
Hilary â€“ their baby brother, known always as the Lamb.
"It" is the Psammead.
The Psammead
The Psammead
In Five Children and It, the Psammead is described as having â€œeyes [that] were on long horns like a snail's eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes; it had ears like a bat's ears, and its tubby body was shaped like a spider's and covered with thick soft fur; its legs and arms were furry too, and it had hands and feet like a monkey'sâ€� and whiskers like a rat. When it grants wishes it stretches out its eyes, holds its breath and swells alarmingly.
The five children find the Psammead in a gravel-pit, which used to be seashore. There were once many Psammeads but the others died because they got cold and wet. It is the only one of its kind left. It is thousands of years old and remembers pterodactyls and other ancient creatures. When the Psammeads were around, they granted any wishes, mostly for food. The wished-for objects would turn into stone at sunset if they were not used that day, but this doesn't apply to the children's wishes because what they wish for is so much more fantastic than the wishes the Psammead had granted in the past. [1] (Chapter 1)
The name Psammead, (pronounced "sammyadd" by the children in the story) appears to be a coinage by Nesbit from the Greek ÏˆÎ¬Î¼Î¼Î¿Ï‚ "sand" after the pattern of dryad , naiad , and oread , implicitly signifying "sand-nymph."
Sequels
The book's ending was clearly intended to leave readers in suspense:
"They did see it [the Psammead] again, of course, but not in this story. And it was not in a sand-pit either, but in a very, very, very different place. It was in a â€“ But I must say no more." [2]
The children reappeared in The Phoenix and the Carpet (1904) and then The Story of the Amulet (1906). The Psammead is off-stage in the first sequel (it is simply mentioned by the phoenix, who visits it three times to ask for a helpful wish when the situation becomes difficult) but plays a significant role in the second, when the children rescue it from a pet shop.
Some fifty years later, the premise of Five Children and It inspired the plot of Half Magic (1954) by the American author of children's books Edward Eager .
The Return of the Psammead (1992) by Helen Cresswell concerns another family of Edwardian children who visit the White House and discover the Psammead. [3]
Four Children and It (2012) by Jacqueline Wilson is a contemporary version, in which four children from a modern blended family encounter the Psammead. [4]
Adaptations
Five Children and It has been adapted for television and film several times:
In 1984â€“85, NHK broadcast a Japanese anime version in 78 episodes, called Onegai! Samia Don . No English dubbed version was ever produced, but it came out in other languages.
Cover from the United Kingdom DVD release of Five Children and It (1991)
In 1991, the BBC turned the story into a six-part series. It was released in the UK under the story's original title, but in the USA it was released as The Sand Fairy. This was followed by The Return of the Psammead in 1993, with the Psammead the only character linking the two series. Both series were scripted by Helen Cresswell , and Francis Wright puppeteered and voiced the Psammead.
In 2004, a film version was released, starring Kenneth Branagh , Freddie Highmore , ZoÃ« Wanamaker , Jonathan Bailey , and Norman Wisdom , with Eddie Izzard as the voice of the Psammead.
It was also adapted as a comic strip by Henry Seabright .
