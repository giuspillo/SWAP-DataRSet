The story is a parody of the Barrymore family of actors, with particular aim taken at John Barrymore and Ethel Barrymore . The character Tony Cavendish, a heavy-drinking womanizer , represents John Barrymore . Julie Cavendish is the prima donna Broadway star Ethel Barrymore . Ethel Barrymore was offended and her critical comments were quoted by the press; however John Barrymore saw the production in Los Angeles and was amused, and congratulated Fredric March on his performance as Tony Cavendish. ( Otto Kruger had played the role on Broadway.)
