The Players of Null-A, usually written The Players of Ā, is a 1956 science fiction novel by A. E. van Vogt originally published as a four-part serial in Astounding Stories from October 1948 to January 1949 (this leads to the mistaken idea that the book was published in 1948 due to the copyright notice). It incorporates concepts from the General semantics of Alfred Korzybski and refers to non-Aristotelian logic. It was published in the UK under the name The Pawns of Null-A. The novel is a continuation of the story of Gilbert Gosseyn from The World of Null-A expanding on the galactic events which drove the interplanetary events of the earlier story.
