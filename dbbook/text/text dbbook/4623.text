When the Lion Feeds is the debut novel of Zambian writer Wilbur Smith. It introduces the Courtney family, whose adventures Smith would tell in many subsequent novels. In 2012 Smith said the novel remained his favourite because it was his first.
Plot
The plot focuses around twin brothers, Sean and Garrick Courtney, and their lives in South Africa in the 19th century, including the Anglo-Zulu War and the Transvaal Gold Rush. [2]
Background
Smith was working as an accountant and had already written a novel The Gods First Make Mad but been unable to find a publisher. [3] After the failure of his first marriage he tried again with a different story:
I wrote about my own father and my darling mother. I wove into the story chunks of early African history. I wrote about black people and white. I wrote about hunting and gold mining and carousing and women. I wrote about love and loving and hating. In short I wrote about all the things I knew well and loved better. I left out all the immature philosophies and radical politics and rebellious posturing that had been the backbone of the first novel. I even came up with a catching title, 'When the Lion Feeds'. [4]
His agent in London, Ursula Winant, managed to sell the book to William Heinemann for an advance of two thousand pounds and an initial print run of ten thousand copies. The book went on to be successful, selling around the world (except in South Africa, where it was banned) and enabling Smith to leave his job and work full time. [4] Charles Pick, who bought the book for Heinemann, later became Smith's agent.
The book was dedicated to Smith's father, whom the author idolised. "When I showed him he was a bit taken aback but Mum said that he always used to carry it around with him to show his mates,â€� said Smith. [5]
The novel was banned in South Africa on the grounds of obscenity and blasphemy. Heinemann appealed this to the South African Supreme Court and succeeded in having the decision overturned. [6] However this was reversed on appeal and the ban stayed. [7]
Smith did not originally envision the Courtney family would become a series but he ended up continually returning to them in later novels. [8]
Proposed Adaptation
Stanley Baker bought the film rights and announced plans to make a movie version after Zulu (1963) but no film resulted. [9]
