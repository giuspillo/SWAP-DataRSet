Topdog/Underdog is a play by Suzan-Lori Parks. Parks received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2002 for the work.
Plot
The play chronicles the adult lives of two African American brothers, Lincoln and Booth, as they cope with women, work, poverty, gambling, racism, and their troubled upbringings.
Production history
Topdog/Underdog had a successful run off-Broadway in 2001 with Don Cheadle and Jeffrey Wright in the lead roles. The play had an extended run on Broadway at the Ambassador Theatre from April 7 - August 11, 2002, in which Cheadle was replaced by Mos Def .
In September 2012, Topdog/Underdog was revived by the Two River Theater Company in Red Bank, New Jersey. [1]
Reception
in The New York Times , critic Ben Brantley wrote, "The play, first produced downtown at the Joseph Papp Public Theater last year, vibrates with the clamor of big ideas, audaciously and exuberantly expressed. Like Invisible Man, Ralph Ellison's landmark novel of 1952, 'Topdog/Underdog' considers nothing less than the existential traps of being African-American and male in the United States, the masks that wear the men as well as vice versa. But don't think for a second that Ms. Parks is delivering a lecture or reciting a ponderous poem. Under the bravura direction of George C. Wolfe, a man who understands that showmanship and intellectual substance are not mutually exclusive, 'Topdog/Underdog' is a deeply theatrical experience." [5]
