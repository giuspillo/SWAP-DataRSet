Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed is a 2005 book by Jared M. Diamond, professor of geography and physiology at University of California, Los Angeles. Diamond's book deals with "societal collapses involving an environmental component, and in some cases also contributions of climate change, hostile neighbors, and trade partners, plus questions of societal responses" (p.  15). In writing the book Diamond intended that its readers should learn from history (p.  23).
The collapse into genocide of Rwanda , caused in part by overpopulation
The failure of Haiti compared with the relative success of its neighbour on Hispaniola , the Dominican Republic
The problems facing a developing nation , China
The problems facing a First World nation, Australia
Part Four concludes the study by considering such subjects as business and globalization , and "extracts practical lessons for us today" (p. 22 â€“ 23). Specific attention is given to the polder model as a way Dutch society has addressed its challenges and the "top-down" and most importantly "bottom-up" approaches that we must take now that "our world society is presently on a non-sustainable course" (p. 498) in order to avoid the "12 problems of non-sustainability " that he expounds throughout the book, and reviews in the final chapter. The results of this survey are perhaps why Diamond sees "signs of hope" nevertheless and arrives at a position of "cautious optimism" for all our futures.
Tim Flannery gave Collapse the highest praise in Science , writing [2]
...the fact that one of the world's most original thinkers has chosen to pen this mammoth work when his career is at his apogee is itself a persuasive argument that Collapse must be taken seriously. It is probably the most important book you will ever read.
The Economist 's review was generally favorable, although the reviewer had two disagreements. First, the reviewer felt Diamond was not optimistic enough about the future . Secondly, the reviewer claimed Collapse contains some erroneous statistics: for instance, Diamond supposedly overstated the number of starving people in the world. [3] University of British Columbia professor of ecological planning William Rees wrote that Collapse's most important lesson is that societies most able to avoid collapse are the ones that are most agile; they are able to adopt practices favorable to their own survival and avoid unfavorable ones. Moreoever, Rees wrote that Collapse is "a necessary antidote" to followers of Julian Simon , such as BjÃ¸rn Lomborg who authored The Skeptical Environmentalist . Rees explained this assertion as follows: [4]
Human behaviour towards the ecosphere has become dysfunctional and now arguably threatens our own long-term security. The real problem is that the modern world remains in the sway of a dangerously illusory cultural myth. Like Lomborg, most governments and international agencies seem to believe that the human enterprise is somehow 'decoupling' from the environment, and so is poised for unlimited expansion. Jared Diamond's new book, Collapse, confronts this contradiction head-on.
Jennifer Marohasy of the think-tank , Institute of Public Affairs wrote a critical review in Energy & Environment , in particular its chapter on Australia's environmental degradation. Marohasy claims that Diamond reflects a popular view that is reinforced by environmental campaigning in Australia, but which is not supported by evidence, and argues that many of his claims are easily disproved. [5]
In his review in The New Yorker , Malcolm Gladwell highlights the way in which Diamond's approach differs from traditional historians by focusing on environmental issues rather than cultural questions. [6]
Diamond's distinction between social and biological survival is a critical one, because too often we blur the two, or assume that biological survival is contingent on the strength of our civilizational values... The fact is, though, that we can be law-abiding and peace-loving and tolerant and inventive and committed to freedom and true to our own values and still behave in ways that are biologically suicidal.
While Diamond does not reject the approach of traditional historians, his book, according to Gladwell, vividly illustrates the limitations of that approach. Gladwell demonstrates this with his own example of a recent ballot initiative in Oregon, where questions of property rights and other freedoms were subject to a free and healthy debate, but serious ecological questions were given scant attention.
Criticisms
Jared Diamond's thesis that Easter Island society collapsed in isolation entirely due to environmental damage is contested by some ethnographers and archaeologists who argue that the introduction of diseases carried by European colonizers and slave raiding , [8] which devastated the population in the 19th century, had a much greater social impact than environmental decline and that introduced animals, first rats and then sheep, were greatly responsible for the island's loss of native flora which came closest to deforestation as late as 1930â€“1960. [9]
The following criticism seem to apply more to Diamond's other book but might be relevant. Military historian and political columnist Victor Davis Hanson agrees with Diamond in that he rejects a racial explanation for Western dominance. But Hanson argues that certain fundamental aspects of Western culture are responsible, specifically political freedom , capitalism , individualism , republicanism , rationalism , and open debate . Hanson has written that Diamond seems "terribly confused" about history, and that environment was "almost irrelevant" to Western success. [10] Hanson adamantly defends the roles of key features of modern democracies, ignoring the fact that the bulk of Diamond's narrative is about the conditions (in the 12,000+ years before the rise of these features after the Middle Ages, especially during the Enlightenment) that allowed for the development of political freedom, capitalism, etc., along with technology and diseases in Eurasia. As Hanson states, Diamond's thesis does not explain the history of every civilization in the last 5000 years, but Diamond does not claim that his theory explains everything.
