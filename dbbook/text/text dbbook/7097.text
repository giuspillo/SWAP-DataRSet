Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book is a 1962 children's book by Dr. Seuss. This book begins with a small bug, named Van Vleck, yawning. This yawn spreads (as yawns are terribly contagious) and then the book follows various creatures, including the Foona Lagoona Baboona, the Collaspable Frink, the Chippendale Mupp, The Oft, and the Krandles, throughout the lands who are sleeping, or preparing to sleep. Towards the end of the book the sleepers in the world are recorded by a special machine ("The Audio Telly O-Tally O-Count"). A Warning is printed on the inside cover of the book that "this book is to be read in bed" as it is intended to put children to sleep. The final line of the book is a simple, unmetered "Good night".
