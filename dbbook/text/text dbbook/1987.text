At the age of 5, he has an accident while climbing a scaffold and is saved due to his mother's prayers to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux. The conditions stated in the prayer for their sons salvation is that he will be donated to Gods work on earth. He is to be sent to Varnhem Abbey, to which his mother has donated the land and is so counted as its founder. Because of a dispute of the validity of the donation the Queen of the Swedes harasses the Cistercian monks into flight. The abbot and his subjects relocate to Denmark awaiting the excommunication of the Swedish royals. One of the brothers of Varnhem and Danish Vitae Scholae is brother Guilbert, a former Knight Templar, who instructs him in the use of the sword and the art of medieval warfare in the Holy Lands. After relocating back to Varnhem again, the Prior of the convent, Father Henri, instructs Arn to witness the outside world for himself before taking the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Arn does so, but fell into the terrible sin of having sexual intercourse with Cecelia, who was also in the nunery. Cecelia got pregnant and told her sister Katarina. Katarina was jealous and told the Head Mother that not only did Cecelia have sex with Arn, but reveals that Arn had had carnal knowledge before marriage with her as well (having seduced him while he was drunk after his first visit to her father's homestead.). He was then condemned to spend 20 years in the Holy Land, as a Knight Templar, and Cecelia was kept in the nunery and her boy child taken away from her and sentenced to 20 years of penance in the convent of Gudhem.
