Background
Noam Chomsky (1928â€“) was born in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Becoming academically involved in the field of linguistics , Chomsky eventually secured a job as Professor of Department of Linguistics & Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . In the field of linguistics, he is credited as the creator or co-creator of the Chomsky hierarchy , the universal grammar theory, and the Chomskyâ€“SchÃ¼tzenberger theorem . Politically, Chomsky had held radical leftist views since childhood, identifying himself with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism . He was particularly known for his critiques of U.S. foreign policy and contemporary state capitalism , and he has been described as a prominent cultural figure. [4]
Chomsky was first approached to write an op-ed column for the New York Times Syndicate on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the basis of his highly influential volume 9/11 (2001). The international attention garnered by the subsequent column, entitled 9-11: Lessons Unlearned, convinced the publishers to commission Chomsky to write roughly 1000-words a month which they would then distribute as op-ed pieces. These are widely picked up overseas, but rarely in the United States and The New York Times itself never published them to its own readers. [5] Internationally, the op-eds have appeared in the mainstream European press including The International Herald Tribune , The Guardian , and The Independent . Regional newspapers in the US that did pick up the op-eds were The Register Guard , The Dayton Daily News , and The Knoxville Voice . A second volume of these, collecting columns from April 2, 2007 to October 31, 2011, was published as Making the Future (2012).
