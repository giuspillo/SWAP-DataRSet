Explanation of the title
The novel's title, The Laughing Policeman, derives from a 1922 song so titled . When Detective Beck receives the record as a Christmas gift from his daughter, Ingrid, he does not think it funny; his first laugh comes when the dead Det. Ã…ke StenstrÃ¶m is vindicated.
Plot
A gunman shoots the passengers of a public transport bus with a sub-machine gun; he kills eight people (including Detective Ã…ke StenstrÃ¶m), and wounds one. Detective Beck and his team suspect the mass-murder is to disguise the murder of Detective StenstrÃ¶m, who was spending his free time investigating the sixteen-year-old murder of a Portuguese prostitute.
Character development
To solve the case, several outsiders are called: Detective Richard Ullholm (a reactionary who informs on his fellow officers as a hobby); Per MÃ¥nsson (introduced in a previous novel; is the man who can find anything); and detective Ulf Nordin (the most tenacious investigator). Ã…sa Torrell, StenstrÃ¶m's girlfriend, plays a significant, emotional, part in the story, and, after slowly recovering from the shock of her boyfriend's murder, admits to planning to join the police.
