Call It Courage is a story set in the Pacific Islands . It chronicles the journey of Mafatu, the son of the chief of Hikueru Island , Tavana Nui.

His father does not recognize him at first, then proudly accepts him on his return. Mafatu's story is told throughout the ages to the future generations.
Comment from the author
"I had been afraid that perhaps in Call It Courage, the concept of spiritual courage might be too adult for children, but the reception of this book has reaffirmed a belief I have long held: that children have imagination enough to grasp any idea, and respond to it, if it is put to them honestly and without a patronizing pat on the head."
