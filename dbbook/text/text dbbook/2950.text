The Case for Israel is a New York Times bestseller by Alan Dershowitz, a law professor at Harvard University. The book responds to common criticisms of Israel. The book is divided into several chapters, each of which addresses what Dershowitz identifies as being particularly strong accusations and myths about Israel, such as "Israel is the 'prime' human rights violator in the world" and "Israel is the cause of the Arab–Israeli conflict. " Each chapter is divided into several sections. "The Accusation" states a common criticism of Israel, "The Accusers" lists several quotations from critics supporting the accusation, "The Reality" contains a short statement contradicting the accusation, and "The Proof" contains Dershowitz's explanation of his viewpoint. Edward Said and Noam Chomsky are among the critics that he quotes the most heavily. Dershowitz has released a sequel in 2005 championing the two state solution. The book, The Case for Peace, explains what he believes is needed to be done in order to achieve peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The political scientist and author Norman Finkelstein has claimed the book is a "hoax" [2] and that some of its citations are plagiarized from From Time Immemorial , a book by Joan Peters . [3] In the 2005 book " Beyond Chutzpah ," Finkelstein alleges that there are 20 different instances where Dershowitz's books uses the same quotes from authors, with the ellipses in the same places, as previous books have. For instance, Dershowitz once (accurately) quotes a remark by Mark Twain using the same ellipses as Peters did when she used the same quotation in her book; in Finkelstein's view, this constituted plagiarism because Dershowitz cited Twain but not Peters in his book.
After a heated exchange between the two on Democracy Now! , in which Finkelstein repeatedly accused Dershowitz of plagiarism and questioned his credentials to teach at Harvard University, [4] Finkelstein released a book, Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History , whose second part is about The Case for Israel. Although repeatedly being approached by third parties to debate the book Dershowitz refused on the ground that he had a "longstanding policy against debating Holocaust deniers, revisionists, trivializers or minimizers".[ citation needed ] A Harvard Law School investigation led by former Harvard president Derek Bok found the plagiarism charges to be without merit. Threatened with a libel lawsuit, Finkelstein agreed to delete all references to "plagiarism" from his book. [5] [6] According to Oxford University 's professor of international relations Avi Shlaim , Finkelstein's charge of plagiarism "is proved in a manner that would stand up in court." [7]
