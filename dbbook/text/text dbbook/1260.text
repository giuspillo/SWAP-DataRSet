She also soon receives word from her father, a sea captain who had seemingly vanished earlier, inviting him to a tropical island inhabited by natives over which he now reigns as king. Pippi and her friends sail to her father's island kingdom, where they become acquainted with the natives living there, Pippi being hailed as "Princess Pippilotta."
