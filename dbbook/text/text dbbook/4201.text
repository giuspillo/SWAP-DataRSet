Woyzeck is a stage play written by Georg Büchner. He left the work incomplete at his death, but it has been variously and posthumously "finished" by a variety of authors, editors and translators. Woyzeck has become one of the most performed and influential plays in the German theatre repertory. Büchner probably began writing the play between June and September 1836. It remained in a fragmentary state at the time of his early death in 1837. Woyzeck was first published in 1879 in a heavily reworked version by Karl Emil Franzos. It received its first performance on November 8, 1913 at the Residenztheater, Munich. Woyzeck deals with the dehumanising effects of doctors and the military on a young man's life. It is often seen as 'working class' tragedy, though it can also be viewed as having another dimension, portraying the 'perennial tragedy of human jealousy'. The play was admired both by the German naturalist Gerhart Hauptmann and, subsequently, by expressionist playwrights. It is loosely based on the true story of Johann Christian Woyzeck, a Leipzig wigmaker and, latterly, a soldier. In 1821, Woyzeck, in a fit of jealousy, murdered Christiane Woost, a widow with whom he had been living. He was later publicly beheaded.

a 1997 stage version by Keith Fowler . Fowler prepared his own translation for the Woyzeck he directed at the University of California, Irvine. In considering the traditional arrangements of scenes â€” whether to start with the scene in which Woyzeck is shaving his captain, the doctorâ€™s lecture, or when Woyzeck is in the woods and hears voices below the ground; and whether to end with Woyzeckâ€™s trial or his drowning â€” Fowler notes how each arrangement makes a different thematic statement, viz.:
Start: Shaving / End: Trial / Statement: Oppression of the lower classes by these in power.
Start: Woods / End: Drowning / Statement: Deranged Woyzeck destroys himself.
Start: Lecture / End: Drowning / Statement: Society disregards Woyzeckâ€™s humanity, eventually discards him.
Start: Lecture / End: Trial / Statement: ...or judges him.
But, as Fowler also comments, what truly counts is "the totality of BÃ¼chner's world, for however the scenes are arranged, we will still have what G. Wilson Knight calls the â€˜burning coreâ€™ of the dramaâ€¦.â€� [5]
