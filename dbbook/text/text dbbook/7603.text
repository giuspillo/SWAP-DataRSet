Synopsis
The story is a darkly comic satire of British youth culture (with hints towards such films as Natural Born Killers [3] ) which revolves round a bookish middle class schoolgirl, who has a bland unexciting life until she meets a strange young boy who convinces her to kill her boyfriend. They then go on the run together for a series of anarchic adventures across Britain.
Meeting up with a group of travellers in a double-decker bus , the pair indulge in more crime and sexual experimentation before making their way to Blackpool to meet their final fate.
Morrison notes in the afterword of the second edition that the story is inspired in part by the myth of Dionysus .
