The Final Programme is a novel by British science fiction and fantasy writer Michael Moorcock. It was the first of his iconic Jerry Cornelius series of novels and stories and was originally published in hardback by Allison & Busby in 1969. It was made into a 1973 film of the same name, although Moorcock was critical of the version released on the screen. Set in a world less abstract and chaotic than depicted in the later volumes, it introduces Jerry Cornelius as a hip superhero and follows his adventures as he attempts to subvert a plot by his disreputable brother Frank and Miss Brunner to build a super computer for nefarious ends. As things turn out, Jerry discovers that "it's a tasty world". Contrary to the apparent chaos of the later Cornelius novels, The Final Programme is quite structured, being an alternate retelling of major episodes of the saga of Elric of Melniboné, with the various characters each taking roles similar to those of the earlier stories: Jerry as Elric, Catherine as Cymoril, and Miss Brunner as Stormbringer.
