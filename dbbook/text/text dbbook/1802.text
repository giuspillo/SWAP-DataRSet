Plot summary
Dominique, a student in Paris has a lover, Bertrand, who one day introduces her to his businessman uncle Luc and his wife FranÃ§oise. Both Luc and Dominique are aware of their mutual attraction from the beginning, but Dominique holds off for fear of hurting both Bertrand and FranÃ§oise, to whom she forms a close attachment. They decide to become lovers, however, spending two weeks in Cannes and promising to not fall in love. Both have a deep fear of hurting their partners, but more so of becoming bored. At the end of these two weeks and on their separation Dominique realises that she may well be in love with Luc. They spend other nights together, but this time tinged with the sadness that Luc does not love Dominique back. When FranÃ§oise eventually finds out about the affair, Dominique must learn to get over Luc and accept the transience of their relationship.
