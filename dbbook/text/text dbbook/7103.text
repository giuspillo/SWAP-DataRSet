Reservation Blues is a 1995 novel by Sherman Alexie. The novel follows the story of the rise and fall of a rock and blues band of Spokane Indians from the Spokane Reservation in Washington. As with many of Alexie’s published works, the story is complex in nature, with an underlying purpose at bringing out the truths of modern Indian lives.
