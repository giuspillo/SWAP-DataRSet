The Between is the first novel by writer Tananarive Due. It was nominated for the 1996 Bram Stoker Award. Part horror novel, part detective story and part speculative fiction, "The Between" is a mix of genres. Yet it is no hybrid. It is a finely honed work that always engages and frequently surprises. -- JAMES POLK, The New York Times
