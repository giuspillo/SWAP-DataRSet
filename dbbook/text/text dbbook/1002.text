Blood Follows is a novella by Steven Erikson set in the world of the Malazan Book of the Fallen. The events of this book take place prior to those in the main series, and do not necessarily concern the main story plot line. Originally published only in Europe by PS Publishing in 2002, the hard cover version had a run of only 300 copies, while the first and second edition paperback versions each had 500 copies printed. All of the first editions were signed by the author. The introduction to the original printing is by Stephen R. Donaldson, an acknowledged fan of Steven Erikson's work. In 2005, Blood Follows was re-published in the United States by Night Shade Books. Again, there was a limited run of signed copies.
