Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! is a children's picture book by Mo Willems. Released by Hyperion Press in 2003, it was Willems' first book for children, and received the Caldecott Honor. The plot is about a bus driver who has to leave so he asks the reader to watch the Pigeon. The pigeon tries many excuses and tries to finagle readers into letting him drive the bus. An animated adaptation of the book won the 2010 Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Children's Video.

A 2011 scientific study entitled "Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus" examined the ability of pigeons to solve the traveling salesperson problem by taking the shortest route to visit multiple feeders in a laboratory. The authors found that pigeons "appeared to plan ahead multiple steps," which provided "clear and strong evidence that animals other than primates are capable of planning sophisticated travel routes." [10] [11]
A parody, "Don't Let The Republican Drive The Bus" (not by Willems) replaces the pigeon with a vulture and advocates Democratic ideals. [12]
