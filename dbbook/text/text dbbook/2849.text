Call and Sarah Louise then meet the Captain, a man who is believed to have lived on the island, but left the island in humiliation. After many adventures, twists in the road, and confusion, Caroline moves to New York to go to college. Soon after, Sara Louise breaks down in front of her mother, and her mother encourages her to leave the island and go to college.

The mother had the first twin, a baby boy, safely. When the second one came out, it is a small and cold baby girl. Since she didn't have an incubator she rushes it to the fireside. She then realizes she forgot about the baby boy and asks about his whereabouts. He is in the basket, sleeping, where his grandmother put him. The twins remind her of her and Caroline. She tells the family to hold the baby boy, keep him warm, and love him. In her mind, she does not want the baby boy to end up like her, sleeping in a basket, alone and forgotten. She finally finds her joy, happiness, and herself in this small town.
