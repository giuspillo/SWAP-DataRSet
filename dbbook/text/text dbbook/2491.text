Plot summary
The action occurs twelve years later on from the last novel, when Hannay, now in his fifties, is called by an old oath to protect the son of a man he once knew, who is also heir to the secret of a great treasure. He obtains help from Sandy Arbuthnot , now Lord Clanroyden, and Lombard. The action takes place in England, Scotland and on the Island of Sheep. This is located in what Buchan describes as 'the Norlands': clearly the Faroe Islands . There are several stereotypical villains, in particular D'Ingraville from The Courts of the Morning , and the book also focuses on Hannay's son, Peter John, now a bright but solemn teenager.
