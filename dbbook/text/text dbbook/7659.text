Overview
The book very quickly introduces the theme, with group sex taking place from the fourth page, and a chapter which begins â€œI really like sucking menâ€™s cocks.â€� Despite this explicit content, critics have identified other aspects in the work, with a review in salon.com stating "the most shocking thing about â€œThe Sexual Life of Catherine M.,â€�... is that it isnâ€™t particularly shocking at all. A good quarter of the time, it works as pornography (and I use the term in a descriptive sense, not a judgmental one); the rest of the time itâ€™s a rumination on the nature of desire and pleasure and the experience of living a life that is specifically arranged to let desire and pleasure have their way with you. Itâ€™s titillating, explicit, dryly funny and sometimes exceedingly puzzling. The only truly shocking thing about it is that it was written by a straight woman and not a gay man." [1]
In the book, Millet writes of orgies attended by up to 150 people, at which she would have sex with around a quarter of those in attendance. She also debates whether sex outdoors is better in country or urban settings, and why she could never be a prostitute.
Millet writes that she has been in an open marriage with one man since the 1970s, who understands her love of sex with multiple partners.
