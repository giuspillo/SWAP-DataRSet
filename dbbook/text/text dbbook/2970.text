-Mikel
-Marla Wolfblade
Medalon has surrendered to foreign invaders, Tarja is once more an outcast, the Defenders have scattered...and their only hope is Damin Wolfblade.
But Damin has his own problems-the High Prince is dead, so Damin must lift the siege on the Hythrun capital and defeat a usurper before he can come to Medalon's aid.
For R'shiel time is running out. She must find a way to bring peace to the divided southern nations, to free Medalon from Karien occupation, and to find the strength to put an end to Loclon. And she has finally accepted her destiny as the Demon Child, which means she must be the one to defeat Xaphista-soon, before the Harshini are destroyed.
But how can she kill a god?
