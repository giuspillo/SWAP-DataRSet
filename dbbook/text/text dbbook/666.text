Plot
In the late 1950s, the Dollanganger family live an idyllic life full of sunshine and love in Gladstone, Pennsylvania . Chris Jr., Cathy, and younger twins Carrie and Cory adore their parents Corrine and Chris Sr., who are loving, and seemingly but far from perfect. A local joke has them nicknamed the Dresden Dolls from their fair complexions, light blonde hair, and blue eyes that are startlingly similar to those of their parents, with Chris resembling his father most strongly, and Cathy their mother.
When their father is killed in a terrible road accident, Corrine explains that they have to leave their home and the bulk of their possessions as these were not fully paid for. Corrine has no skills suitable for the workforce, and decides to relocate her children to their grandparents' home, where they will be able to stay. Corrine was disowned by her extremely wealthy parents for marrying Christopher and she has to beg for their help, which is given on the condition that for the first night, the children are hidden from their grandfather. The old man is very ill, and the shock of knowledge of the children would apparently kill him.
Smuggled into the northern wing of the giant mansion, the children are hidden in a bedroom on the top floor with two double beds and an attached bathroom, plus a cupboard that conceals a doorway into the attic above. Their grandmother is very fierce, formidable, and strict, while their mother seems utterly cowed by her. Once locked into their room, Chris and Cathy have to take care of their four year old twin siblings.
The next day, their mother reveals more of the truth - she was cast out because Christopher Sr. was her half uncle, which counts as incest . Her deeply religious parents disowned her and vowed never to help her again. Now her father relents, although he has the grandmother whip Corrine from her head to her heels. Corrine explains that he has only forgiven her because he has no other children - her two brothers died years before - and so she will inherit his massive fortune when he dies, which she keeps saying will be very soon. Until then she must keep the children hidden, and begs them to understand and submit. Adoring their mother as they do, the children agree to stay locked up in the attic.
Once a day their grandmother brings a basket of food for them, although she orders them not to speak to her. They are to clean their own room, do their own laundry in the bath tub, and take care of the twins. She also stipulates no contact between brothers and sisters, as this would be sinful. She makes it clear that she despises the children since they are "devils' spawn" bred from incest and will beat them bloody if they disobey.
One month becomes two, and soon the children are resigned to remaining in the attic until their grandfather dies and they can collect their inheritance. Underfed, with little fresh air or sunlight, they cover the attic with paper flowers and plants to make it seem less frightening to the small twins, who more and more see Chris and Cathy as their parents. Their mother brings them games, books, and toys , and at first visits every day, although that soon changes to weekly visits. Chris wants to be a doctor and reads medical books, Cathy practices her ballet, and the twins chatter in their own private language.
Soon a full year passes, and Cathy becomes more and more frustrated by their imprisonment. She is frequently irritated by her mother and challenges her over how much fun she has out in the world, enjoying sailing and delightful activities, looking healthy and beautiful while her children are locked away with monotonous cold food, no fresh air nor sunlight, no freedom, and little to do. She notes that her mother has stopped taking secretarial classes and trying to find work in order to support them, which she had promised to do when they were first locked up. After asking if they can be sent to a school or kept in a house far away, maintained by the money which is handed out lavishly to Corrine by her father, Corrine refuses, saying there is too much risk that her father will find out.
Cathy notes that their mother spends more time away from them, constantly has new clothes and expensive jewelry which she claims have paste stones, makes excuses and promises about how her father will soon die, yet doesn't seem to care that they are without any freedom despite professing eternal love for them.
At Christmas, their mother allows Chris and Cathy to sneak down to watch some of the grand party that is taking place, on condition that they go back after an hour and she will then lock them in again so their grandmother won't know. Dazzled by the wealth they see, Chris and Cathy drool over the idea of hot food, something they never get. Cathy notes how their mother spends all her time with a handsome dark haired man and discusses her being in love with him. They return to their room, but Chris decides to explore some of the house and goes out again. Corrine returns before he comes back and slaps him for betraying her trust. Chris reveals to Cathy that their mother has a giant and utterly beautiful suite of rooms filled with expensive clothes, jewels, and priceless furniture.
As time keeps going slowly on, Chris and Cathy go through puberty, awakening hormones and secret desires which both of them suppress. With their entire world shrunk to their small siblings, mother, and grandmother, and their joint responsibility as parents to Carrie and Cory, both become increasingly frustrated by their mother. The siblings become closer than ever as they depend utterly on one another.
When the twins become dangerously ill yet are refused a doctor, Cathy's anger at her mother grows, fueled by her neglect and the frustration of being locked up. Several times she argues with Chris over her constant questions about when they will be released and her changing view of their mother: Chris adores Corrine and idolizes her as the perfect woman, but he too is beginning to doubt her.
One day, their mother goes away for a long trip and the grandmother is left in charge of the children. Cathy has never seen her now changed body in the mirror as she has no privacy to undress before the full length looking glass in the bedroom, so waits until her siblings are upstairs to strip naked. Chris comes downstairs and catches Cathy inspecting her naked body, which he admires, although admitting that he shouldn't do so. The grandmother enters just as Cathy is changing back into her dress while Chris is present. She orders Chris to cut off Cathy's beautiful long blonde hair, which is a favorite feature, but he refuses. During the night, their grandmother injects Cathy with morphine and covers her head in tar. Chris manages to remove the tar without cutting off all the hair by mixing chemicals from his chemistry set. The grandmother refuses them food for an entire week, so Chris is forced to feed the twins his own blood in order to keep them alive. Cathy cuts off a little of the front of her hair, covering the rest with a turban so it looks like she has shaved her head and the grandmother finally feeds them, although she later beats Chris and then Cathy into concussion when they tell her she has a filthy mind and has forced the sinful situation on them by keeping them imprisoned alone together, and she is wicked before God for starving them and keeping them locked up and never showing kindness.
When their mother returns after six months, it is revealed that she has married the dark haired man, Bart Winslow, who is her father's lawyer and 8 years younger than she, and has been on honeymoon in Europe and Canada. She brings expensive gifts, but the children are stone-faced after her long neglect and the fact that her new husband doesn't know about them either. Their grandfather still lives, and Cathy begs for their mother to spend the money she has on a house for them so they can be out of the attic, but is refused.
By now the twins no longer know their mother, and Chris tells Corrine that she is ignoring that they are all growing up. Chris offers to leave with Cathy and the twins and make their own way in the world, leaving Corrine to inherit and no longer have anything to do with them, but Corrine refuses, locking them in for a week with little food.
Making a plan to escape, Cathy and Chris fashion a key from wood and use it to sneak down to their mother's room. Deciding to run away, Chris steals money from their mother and stepfather's room, little by little, so that they have enough for a train fare and to care for the twins.
Weak from lack of food and no sunshine, the twins have grown only two inches in their time locked away. Pale and fragile, Chris and Cathy are terrified that they will die before their mother can inherit. The twins are now uncomfortable with their mother, clinging to Cathy and Chris, and still act much younger than their age of nearly seven. Corrine never seems to look at the twins, refusing to see what her quest to inherit is costing them. She also ignores that Chris is now a man in both mind and body, forced into maturity by being the "father" of the family in the attic. Corrine also ignores Cathy's growth, buying her clothes which are not altered for her breasts and hips, nor giving her a bra to wear. Cathy notes that their mother brings them gold-leafed , embossed leather-bound books which cost a fortune, but never once spends this money on keeping them somewhere that would allow freedom and the ability to have the twins grow up.
One night, Cathy joins Chris in their mother's room and is fascinated by the wonderful array of clothes and glamorous items. She also finds a hidden book of pornographic images, which disturbs her. Cathy tries to convince Chris to take small items of jewelry for them to sell, but he refuses, stubbornly clinging to his childish idea of his adored mother.
Always previously denying treats, the grandmother begins to bring them powdered sugar doughnuts each day which Cory particularly loves. Each child is suffering from the long internment and is often ill, so one day when Chris is unable to leave his bed, Cathy goes alone to their mother's room and finds her stepfather asleep. Realizing that he is much younger than their mother and very handsome, she kisses his sleeping mouth, something Chris later discovers, making him furious. His frustrations bursting out all at once, he rapes Cathy, but which supposedly turns consensual. The two promise each other never to do it with each other again.
The next day, Cory is very ill, so ill that their grandmother calls in Corrine and Cathy demands that Cory be taken to the hospital before he dies. When Corrine hesitates, Cathy's hatred bursts forth, and she swears that she will make her mother pay if Cory dies because money won't buy back a son. Cory is taken to the hospital but dies. Utterly demented by grief, Carrie stops talking, eating, and drinking, unable to live without her twin. Chris finally agrees to take some of the jewels and escape with what they have, but returns aghast when he discovers that Corrine and Bart have moved; all their jewels and personal possessions are gone.
Chris goes to his grandfather's room, and discovers that the old man had died nine months earlier. Corrine had finally inherited the money, but left her children locked up. Further, they conclude that their grandmother had mixed arsenic onto the sugar doughnuts, slowly poisoning them and killing Cory, a theory they test on Cory's pet mouse , which quickly dies after eating some. The last insult is that their mother left behind, forgotten, a photo of their father, and the wedding and engagement rings he gave her, which Chris takes when they leave.
The pair run away with Carrie, reaching the nearest town before Chris reveals the final horrible truth: that it was Corrine who killed Cory. Their grandfather added a codicil in his will saying that if it were ever proved that Corrine had children from her first marriage, she would forfeit her inheritance. She is also prohibited from having children in her new marriage or she will forfeit the money and pay back what she has spent. Choosing wealth over her children, Corrine had slowly tried to murder them.
Deciding to stay together and protect Carrie before taking revenge, the elder siblings dispose of their evidence, the poisoned doughnut and dead mouse, and leave with Carrie to somewhere filled with sunshine and flowers, while their mother must live with the knowledge that she has lost all her children and has no chance of having more. Revenge will be served cold.
The book was adapted into a film of the same name in 1987.
A second adaptation was released on January 18, 2014, on the Lifetime network starring Heather Graham as Corrine and Ellen Burstyn as the Grandmother, with Kiernan Shipka as Cathy. [1]
Controversy
The book's success was not without controversy. The commission of incest between an adolescent brother and sister in the novel has led to its being banned in certain areas at different times. Chariho High School in Rhode Island removed it because it contained "offensive passages concerning incest and sexual intercourse." In 1994, it was removed from the Oconee County school libraries due to "the filthiness of the material." [2]
The book was much disputed when the novel was said to be based on a true story. For many years there was no evidence to support this claim, and the book was passed off as fiction. Nonetheless, the official V.C. Andrews website claims to have contacted one of Andrews's relatives. This unidentified relative claimed Flowers in the Attic was loosely based on a faintly similar account. While at the "University of Virginia hospital for treatment...she developed a crush on her young doctor. He and his siblings had been locked away in the attic for over 6 years to preserve the family wealth." [3]
