It begins when they are called to a close in the Royal Mile where an advocate by the name of Michael Mortimer has been savagely murdered and mutilated. It isn't long before another murder takes place in a similar location and the police think that it is likely to be the work of a psychopathic serial killer . However, the case takes a dramatic twist when Mortimer's fiancee is also found dead and it appears to Bob Skinner that there is a definite connection despite three seemingly random murders in between, leading to what could be a deep-rooted international conspiracy.
