Rhyme Stew is a collection of poems for children by Roald Dahl, illustrated by Quentin Blake. In a sense it's a more adult version of Revolting Rhymes. The poems either parody well known fairy tales nursery rhymes or are little stories thought up by Dahl himself. Most of the stories contain slight sexual references. Due to slightly risqué material this book carries a warning that it is unsuitable for "small people".
