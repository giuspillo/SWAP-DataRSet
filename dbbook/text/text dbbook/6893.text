The French Lieutenant’s Woman (1969), by John Fowles, is a period novel inspired by the 1823 novel Ourika, by Claire de Duras, which Fowles translated into English in 1977 (and revised in 1994). Fowles was a great aficionado of Thomas Hardy, and, in particular, likened his heroine, Sarah Woodruff, to Tess of the d'Urbervilles, the protagonist of Hardy’s popular novel of the same name (1891). In 1981, director Karel Reisz and writer Harold Pinter adapted the novel as a film, starring Meryl Streep. During 2006, it was adapted for the stage, by Mark Healy, in a version which toured the UK that year. In 2005, the novel was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the one hundred best English-language novels from 1923 to present.
Background
By the time Fowles published The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969), he had established a reputation with his novels The Collector (1963) and The Magus (1965). During its writing, he was working on the screenplay for the film adaptation of The Magus , and The Collector had been adapted as a film released in 1965, gaining him more attention. [6]
Fowles said the novel was inspired by a persistent image of a 'Victorian Woman,' whom he later developed as the character Sarah Woodruff. In a 1969 essay titled "Notes on an Unfinished Novel," Fowles reflects on his writing process. He said he had an image during the autumn of 1966 of "A woman [who] stands at the end of a deserted quay and stares out to see." [7] He determined that she belonged to a "Victorian Age" and had "mysterious" and "vaguely romantic" qualities. [7] He made a note at the time about the function of the novel, saying
You are not trying to write something of the Victorian novelists forgot to write; but perhaps something of them failed to write. And: Remember the etymology of the word. A novel is something new. It must have relevance to the writer's now - so don't ever pretend you live in 1867; or make sure the reader knows it's a pretence." [8]
In an appended comment, dated "October 27, 1967", he writes that he finished the first draft novel at about 140,000 words. [9]
Throughout the essay, Fowles describes inspirations and issues important to the novel's creation, including his debt to other authors such as Thomas Hardy . He claimed to be surprised at the primary role taken by the female character Sarah in the novel. [10] These influences were not his only inspiration. Later Fowles noted that the characters and story of The French Lieutenant's Woman also related to Claire de Duras 's 1823 novel Ourika , featuring a tragic affair between an African woman and French military man. Fowles published a translation into English of Ourika in 1977. [1]
Plot summary
The Cobb at Lyme Regis, near where Smithson and Ernestina first encounter Sarah.
Set in the mid-nineteenth century, the narrator identifies the novel's protagonist as Sarah Woodruff, the Woman of the title, also known as "Tragedy" and as "The French Lieutenant's Whore". She lives in the coastal town of Lyme Regis , as a disgraced woman, supposedly abandoned by a French naval officer named Varguennes. Unknown to her at first, he was married to another woman. Varguennes had returned to France. She spends her limited time off at The Cobb , a pier jutting out to sea, where she stares at the sea.
One day, Charles Smithson, a gentleman, and Ernestina Freeman, his fiancÃ©e and a daughter of a wealthy tradesman, see Sarah walking along the cliffside. Ernestina tells Charles something of Sarah's story, and he becomes curious about her. Though continuing to court Ernestina, Charles has several more encounters with Sarah, meeting her clandestinely three times. During these meetings, Sarah tells Charles of her history, and asks for his emotional and social support. During the same period, he learns of the possible loss of inheritance from his elderly uncle, who has become engaged to a woman young enough to bear him an heir. Meanwhile, Charles's servant Sam falls in love with Ernestina's maid Mary.
Charles falls in love with Sarah and asks her to go with him to Exeter. Returning from a journey to consult with Ernestina's father related to his uncertain inheritance, Charles stops in Exeter as if to visit Sarah.
From there, the narrator, who intervenes throughout the novel and becomes a prominent character at the end, offers three different moments where the novel could end:
First ending: Charles does not visit Sarah, but immediately returns to Lyme Regis to reaffirm his love for Ernestina; they marry and the marriage never becomes extremely happy. Charles enters trade under Ernestina's father, Mr. Freeman. The narrator pointedly notes the lack of knowledge about Sarah's fate. Charles tells Ernestina about an encounter which he implies is with the "French Lieutenant's Whore", but elides the sordid details, and the matter is ended. The narrator dismisses this ending as a daydream by Charles, before the alternative events of the subsequent meeting with Ernestina are described. Critic Michelle Phillips Buchberger describes this first ending as "a semblance of verisimilitude in the traditional 'happy ending'" found in actual Victorian novels. [11]
Before the second and third endings, the narrator appears as a minor character sharing a railway compartment with Charles. He tosses a coin to determine the order in which he will portray the other two possible endings, emphasising their equal plausibility. They are as follows:
Second ending: Charles and Sarah have a rash sexual encounter in which Charles realises that Sarah is a virgin. Reflecting on his emotions during this, Charles ends his engagement to Ernestina, and proposes to Sarah through a letter. Charles's servant Sam fails to deliver the letter, and, after Charles breaks his engagement, Ernestina's father disgraces him. His uncle marries and his wife bears an heir, ensuring the loss of the expected inheritance. To escape the social suicide and depression caused by his broken engagement, Charles goes abroad to Europe and America. Ignorant of Charles' proposal, Sarah flees to London without telling her lover. During Charles' trips abroad, his lawyer searches for Sarah, finding her two years later living with several artists (the Rossettis ), and enjoying an artistic, creative life. Charles is told Sarah had a child by him; he believes they have a possible chance for reunion and future as a family.
Third ending: the narrator re-appears, standing outside the house where the second ending occurred; at the aftermath. He turns back his pocket watch by fifteen minutes and leaves by carriage. Events are the same as in the second-ending version until Charles finds Sarah in London, when their reunion is sour. It is possible that they had no child together; Sarah does not mention one, and expresses no interest in continuing the relationship. Charles leaves the house, intending to return to the United States, and sees the carriage, in which the narrator was thought gone. This raises the question: is Sarah a manipulating, lying woman of few morals, exploiting Charles's love to get what she wants?
Characters
The Narrator â€“ as in other works of metafiction , the narrator's voice frequently intervenes in the story with a personality of its own. Though the voice appears to be that of Fowles, Magali Cornier Micheal notes that chapter 13, which discusses the role of author and narrator within fiction, distinguishes between the author's role in the text and the narrator's. [12] Alice Ferrebe describes the narrator as both a lens for critiquing traditional gender roles and a perpetuation of the perspectives on gendered identity perpetuated by the male gaze . [13]
Sarah Woodruff â€“ the main protagonist according to the narrator. Formerly a governess, she becomes disgraced after an illicit, but unconsummated, liaison with an injured French naval merchant. The feminist critic, Magali Cornier Micheal argues that she is more a plot devise, not interpretable as a main character because her thoughts and motivations are only interpreted from the perspective of outside male characters. Sarah offers a representation of myth or symbol within a male perspective on women. [14]
Charles Smithson â€“ the main male character. Though born into a family with close ties to nobility, Smithson does not possess a title but has a sizable income and considerable education. Early in the novel he is described both as a casual naturalist and a Darwinist . Though trying to become an enlightened and forward-thinking individual, the narrator often emphasises, through commentary on his actions and situation, that his identity is strongly rooted in the traditional social system. [14] Moreover, conflicting identification with social forces, such as science and religion , lead Smithson to an existential crisis. [15]
Ernestina Freeman â€“ Smithson's fiance and daughter to a London-based owner of department stores. Unlike Sarah, Ernestina's temperament is much less complex, and much more simple-minded.
Sam Farrow â€“ Charles's Hackney servant with aspirations to become a haberdasher . Throughout the novel, Sam becomes the narrator's model for the working class peoples of Victorian Britain, comparing Sam's identity with Charles's ignorance of that culture. According to critic David Landrum, the tension between Sam and Charles Smithson importantly demonstrates Marxist class struggle , though often gets overlooked by criticism discussing Charle's relationship to Sarah. [16]
Dr Grogan â€“ an Irish doctor in the town of Lyme Regis who both advises the various upper-class families in the town, and becomes an adviser to Charles. His education and interest in Darwin and other education make him a good companion with Charles.
Mr Freeman â€“ The father of Ernestina, he earned his wealth as an owner of a drapery and clothes sales chain of stores. He "represents the rising entrepreneurial class in England" which stands in stark contrast to the old money which Smithson comes from. [16]
Aunt Tranter â€“ a prominent member of Lyme Regis society who is friends with Grogan and, as her maternal aunt, hosts Ernestina during her stay.
Mrs Poulteney - a wealthy widow and, at the beginning of the novel, the employer of Sarah Woodruff. Hypocritical, and hypersensitive, her character fulfills the archetype of high-society villainess.
Mary â€“ stereotypical lower class servant to Ernestina Freeman and future wife to Sam Farrow.
Style and structure
Like many other postmodern novels , Fowles uses multiple different stylistic and structural techniques to demonstrate his thematic concerns in The French Lieutenant's Woman. Many literary critics explore the importance of the narrator and the narration, the intertextual references to other literary works, and the multiple endings.
Narration
Throughout the novel, the omniscient narrative voice alongside a series of footnotes seem to objectively reflect on his difficulties of controlling the characters, the conventions that are expected of a "Victorian novel" and analyses of differences in 19th-century customs and class. The narrator often returns to discussions of high importance literature and scholarship of the period, like the theories of Charles Darwin , the radical politics of Karl Marx , and the works of Matthew Arnold , Alfred, Lord Tennyson , and Thomas Hardy . [17] Through this metafictional and metahistorical voice, the clearly contemporary postmodern narrator questions the role of the author and the historian in thinking about the past. [18] [19] In her article discussing the use of paratext , or the contextualizing text printed in the book such as the footnotes and epigraphs, she argues that the novel's paratext forces the reader, like in other postmodern works, to rethink the importance of such peripheral material that in other contexts will get overlooked in light of preference for the main text. [20] Instead of nicely complementing the main plot and adding meaning, these paratextual elements do not always contribute to the effectiveness of the novel and oftenact to unseat the authority of the narrative voice. [19]
Intertextuality
Beyond the relationship to the authorial voice Part of the books metafictional discourse often has to do with its intertextuality . In the epigraphs for each chapter, the book gestures towards a number of important 19th-century texts and ideas. Partially, references to other texts act in "ironic play", parodied by how the novel emulates other Victorian conventions throughout the text. [21] Linda Hutcheons describes the works of William Thackery , George Eliot , Charles Dickens , Froude and Thomas Hardy as direct inspirations for this parody. [21] In his discussion of science and religion in the novel, John Glendening notes that both character commentary on Darwin's publications along with the epigraphs mentioning those works as direct contributor's to the novels emphasis on science superseding religion. [22] Similarly, by quoting Marx with the first epigraph, along with multiple subsequent epigraphs, thematically the novel directs attention towards the socio-economic situations created within the novel. [16] Deborah Bowen notes the trend in literary critics struggle to find reading of the epigraphs that help understand the themes of the novel, and argues that the poor synchronicity of epigraphs with text "disperses the authority of the narrative voice, thus destroying his power to speak as a moralist." [19] For Bowen, the epigraphs support the satire of Victorian fiction conventions in the novel.
Multiple endings
Often critics will comment on the novel's multiple endings. Each offers a possible ending for Charles's pursuit of Sarah: the first ends with Charles married to Ernestina, the second with a successful reestablishment of a relationship with Sarah, and the third with Charles cast back into the world without a partner. Michelle Phillips Buchberger discusses these endings as a demonstration of "Fowles's rejection of a narrow mimesis " of reality. [23]
Critical concerns
Though a best-seller, the novel also received significant scrutiny by literary critics. Especially during the 1960s and 70s, a novel with great popularity and significant academic scrutiny is unusual; in literary study, the canon and its academic defenders often focused on " high literary " works that didn't have larger popular followings. In her study of postmodernism, Linda Hutcheon described The French Lieutenant Woman's binary of popular and academic interest as a paradox similar to the postmodern thematic binaries produced within the novel's content. [3] Because of its prominence since publication, the novel has received a variety of different academic re-examinations in light of numerous themes. Some of the most popular concerns for the novel are its discussion of gender, especially questioning "Is the novel a feminist novel?", its engagement with metafictional and metahistorical concepts and its treatment of science and religion.
Gender
The novel creates a number of binaries between men and women. Michelle Phillips Buchberger argues that The French Lieutenant's Woman, along with Fowles two earlier novels The Collector (1963) and The Magus (1965), portrays a fundamental a binary between the male and female characters: the female characters act as an elite set of "creators" or "educated, visionary, and predominantly female" characters who provide the facilitation for evolution "in existential terms" of the male "'collectors', whose traits are present in all of Fowles's flawed male protagonists." [24] Though acknowledging such binaries in the role of the characters, critic Alice Ferrebe does not treat these binaries as necessary thematic elements. Rather, the binaries demonstrate what she calls a gendered "scopic politics", or a politics created by a gaze (not dissimilar from the "male gaze" noticed in cinema studies), that constructs an artificial gender binary within Fowle's early novels (as opposed to a multiplicity of socially constructed genders ). [25] For Ferrebe, this binary creates a tension, especially with Sarah, who becomes a violent fetishised objectified "other", differentiated from the male characters like Charles. [26]
Feminist novel
A number of critics have treated the novel as a feminist novel . The novel's narrator demonstrates and proclaims a feminist approach to women: [27] Sarah is presented as a more liberated and independently willed woman as compared to the other model female characters, such as Ernestina and her aunt. In a 1985 interview by Jan Relf , Fowles declared himself a "feminist". [28]
Magali Cornier Micheal criticises this reading of the text, saying that the novel's overwhelming reliance on male perspectives on women and feminism prevents the novel from meeting feminist objectives. [14] Similarly, Michelle Phillips Buchberger argues that The French Lieutenant's Woman, along with Fowles' two earlier novels The Collector (1963) and The Magus (1965), proclaimed a "pseudo-feminism" while advocating some feminist ideas.But, she says they are permeated by a "fetishism [of women that] perpetuates the idea of woman as 'other'". [27] Alice Ferrebe also notes that, despite Fowles' attempts to critique masculine values, his novels remain male fantasies demonstrative of the "compromises and contradictions" created by the gendered situation in which he was writing. [29] Other literary critics, such as William Palmer, Peter Conradi, Bruce Woodcock and Pamela Cooper, have also critiqued Fowles' claims to a feminist perspective and representation. [notes 1]
Metafiction, historiography and metahistory
In her important study of postmodernity and its poetics in literature, Linda Hucheon describes this novel as definitive of a genre she calls " historiographic metafiction ". She defines this postmodern genre as "well-known and popular novels which are both intensely self-reflexive yet paradoxically also lay claim to historical events and personages." [5] Typically postmodern, this genre of fiction blends the creation of imagined narratives with critique on the various modes in which we create knowledge, such as history and literature. [5] Important to her discussion of the genre's post-modernist style, The French Lieutenant's Woman more specifically bridges different discourses that usually remain separated, such as academic history , literary criticism, philosophy and literature. [3]
The text's representations of the past introduce anachronistic perspectives on the time and the characters. For example, in her queer studies -based article, "Historical Romance, Gender and Heterosexuality", Lisa Fletcher argues that The French Lieutenant's Woman, by relying on a "good love story" as the central means of representing the past, projects a contemporary hetero-normative sexuality on the history of Victorian England. [30] For Fletcher, Fowles' paradoxical treatment of Sarah as both a Victorian character and as a desirable "modern woman," through feminist gestures and sexual tension between Charles and Sarah, confines the historical set characters and their experience to stereotypical heterosexual romance. [31] Fletcher believes that overall the text creates a stereotypical and limited perspective on the past, essentially "hereosexualising the passage of (and relationship to) history". [32]
Science and religion

A conflicted relationship between science and religion has been frequent in both historical studies of Victorian history and Neo-Victorian novels . In his chapter on The French Lieutenant in his book, Evolution and the Uncrucified Jesus, John Glendening argues that Fowles' novel is one of the first neo-Victorian novels to handle the dynamic created between science and religion in Victorian identity. Glendening notes that more generally "Christian ideas and conventions become appropriated in the service of a secularist and extensional version of truth." [33]
Glendening says that Fowles uses commentary on Darwinism "to comment on characters and their experience and to forward a view of natural and human reality opposed to Christian doctrine, and, within limits amenable to existentialist philosophy. " [34] In general, Glendening sees ideas of science and religion as central to the personal and social identities that develop within the novel, but creating symbolically conflictual binaries. He suggests that Fowles manoeuvres these conflictual forces to favour an existential self-revelation exhibited through the main character of Smithson, leading to a conclusion that "the freedom implicit in accepting alienation should be exercized in overcoming it." [35]
Contemporary reception
The novel received critical attention at its initial publication, as Fowles was achieving a reputation. The reviews are mixed, both positively praising and critiquing its style, plot and approach to metafiction and metahistory. The following samples those responses: [notes 2]
The November 1969 New York Times review by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt warned readers to "be certain there's only one log on the fire. If, unhappily, you lack the fireplace by which this book should be read, set an alarm clock." [36] Lehmann-Haupt found the book to begin as "irresistibly novelistic that he has disguised it as a Victorian romance," yet the metafictional construction by the end positively "explodes all the assumptions of our Victorian sensibilities." [36] Time magazine's November 1969 review described the novel as "resourceful and penetrating talent at work on that archaic form." [37] In March 1970, the magazine American Libraries named the novel as one of the "Notable Books of 1969," calling it "A successful blending of two worlds as the author writes in modern terminology of the Victorian era." [2]
Not all of the reviews were positive; for example, Roger Sale in The Hudson Review largely criticized the novel, saying, "At times it seems that the commentary is not so bad and the novel awful, but at others Fowles makes the novel almost work and the comments are embarrassingly vulgar." [38] Ultimately, the reviewer concluded that the novel was "stumbling and gauche and much much too long, but curiously attractive too." [38]
Because of academic interest in metahistory and metafiction, the novel continues to receive extended study by scholars. For discussion of scholarly perspectives, see the above sections on Style and Themes .
Publication history
The novel has been reprinted in numerous editions and translated into many languages: Taiwanese, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Chinese, German, Russian, Polish, and Spanish. [39] The novel was originally published in 1969 by Little Brown and Company in both Boston and Toronto . [39] The novel has also been published in a number of English editions from different publishers, represented in the following list (with publication date in parenthesis): [39]
