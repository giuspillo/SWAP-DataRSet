Plot
Princess Elizabeth plans on marrying Prince Ronald, who is practically perfect. However, a dragon arrives who destroys her kingdom, kidnaps Ronald, and burns all her clothes so that she has no choice but to wear a paper bag. Elizabeth follows the dragon and Ronald, and seeking to rescue her fiancÃ©, challenges the dragon to burn forests with fire and to fly around the world. The dragon completes the tasks but after flying around the world a second time becomes tired and falls asleep. Elizabeth rescues Ronald, who is ungrateful and tells her to return when she looks more like a princess. Elizabeth realizes that she is better off without Ronald and sets off into the sunset to live her own life.
Characters
Princess Elizabeth: A brave, smart and resilient young woman, Elizabeth's quest to save Ronald from the dragon shows her how unworthy Ronald is of her loyalty and affection.
Prince Ronald: Ronald is revealed to be a narcissistic and selfish prince. He has picked Elizabeth for his queen, even though he does not really love her. When the dragon attacks the castle and kidnaps him, Elizabeth goes to great lengths to rescue him, but he does not appreciate the love she has shown him. Elizabeth realizes that he is a shallow, conceited jerk and they part.
Dragon: He is the typical depiction of the European dragon , with green scaly skin, an alligator belly, two small wings, and four scaly feet with eagle talons. He can breathe fire, which puts him at the very top of the animal food chain and makes him physically superior to mankind in the medieval time period in which the story is set. His flames are extremely powerful. In the plot, he attacks Princess Elizabeth's castle and kidnaps Prince Ronald.
