Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern is a science fiction novel by the American-Irish author Anne McCaffrey. It was the seventh book published in the Dragonriders of Pern series, more than twenty books by Anne and eventually her son Todd McCaffrey. With this book, McCaffrey jumped 1000 years back in Pern history from the setting of the first book, Dragonflight, to a time memorialized in song and rendered legendary from the standpoint of the previous books.
Plot summary
The story involves a deadly disease that nearly wipes out the Pernese population. Moreta is a weyrwoman at Fort Weyr who sets out to save the human population, racing against time itself. The follow-up novel, Nerilka's Story , tells the tale of the same event from a different perspective.
Themes
The book addresses such issues as quarantine , public response to emergency restrictions on travel and assembly, and also describes how "modern" forms of transportation , especially air travel , can spread a disease worldwide during its incubation period , allowing the disease to spread far more widely before pathologists are able to recognize the magnitude of the outbreak .
Chronology
Moreta was the last Pern book published before The Atlas of Pern (1984), a companion book prepared by Karen Wynn Fonstad in consultation with McCaffrey. As such, Moreta's geographical settings from peninsulas to stables are illustrated by maps and other drawings and its chronology is explicitly presented in the Atlas.
