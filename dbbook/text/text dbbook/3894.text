As we move into the rising action we see Gopalâ€™s priorities and thought process changes as he is exposed to American way of life as earlier he said â€œI am only going to classes, library and homeâ€� but goes with Randy to see a real bar. He gets absorbed in American way of life as he even asks for cigarette to impress the lady at bar. He meets Anand (the only other Indian on campus) and dislikes him as he portrays America in a superior class and thinks â€œIndia has a lot of growing up to do and America will show the wayâ€�.

Eventually, he takes decision to continue his study and even goes with Randy to Springfield ( Randyâ€™s hometown).
