Effi Briest is widely considered to be Theodor Fontane’s masterpiece and one of the most famous German realist novels. Thomas Mann once said that if one had to reduce one’s library to six novels, Effi Briest would have to be one of them. Published from 1894 to 1895 as a serial novel in the Deutsche Rundschau, a German magazine, it was first published in book form in 1896. The novel marks a watershed and climax at once in the poetic realism of literature and forms a thematic trilogy on marriage in the nineteenth century from the female point of view along with the more famous Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary. All three are adultery tragedies.
Plot introduction
Seventeen-year-old Effi Briest, the daughter of a German aristocrat, is married off to 38-year-old Baron Geert von Innstetten, who courted her mother Luise and was spurned for his status, which he has now improved.
Plot summary
Puerile Effi Briest, who is attracted by social honour, moves to the small Baltic town of Kessin. Her husband is away for weeks at a time, and Effi, who is shunned by local nobles, finds but one friend. Her suspicions their house may be haunted are, perhaps on purpose, not entirely laid to rest by Innstetten. When she says there may be a ghost, he calls her fears meaningless. The scorn he would bear if people knew of her terror would stall his career; hence his angry reply.
When Major Crampas arrives, Effi cannot help but relish his attentions despite his being a married womaniser, and their love is consummated. Her husband looks down on Crampas, whom he finds a lewd philanderer with cavalier views of law. Crampas says Innstetten is patronising.
Years later, Effiâ€™s daughter Annie is growing up and the three move to Berlin due to Innstettenâ€™s ascent. All seems well, but when Effiâ€™s letters to Crampas are found by her husband, he decides to divorce and gets custody of Annie, whom he makes disdain Effi. When Effi and Annie shortly meet some years later, it is clear the two are estranged. Effi stops trying to establish a good rapport with Annie.
The Briests disown Effi, thinking it ill behoves them to deal with someone who tarnished their name. Innstetten tells Crampas he wants to duel; he agrees and is killed by Innstetten, who reappraises his deed. The halcyon days of his life are past: Even his career fails to delight him.
Her parents take Effi back when she is smitten with nervous disease; her grief is torturous. Facing death, she asks Luise to tell Innstetten about her regrets and willingness to forgive him. Her death forms a rather symmetrical ending that matches the novelâ€™s start. In the end scene, her parents vaguely concede guilt for her fate without daring to question the social canons that sparked the tragedy.
Background
Manfred von Ardenne â€™s grandmother Baroness Elisabeth von Ardenne (nÃ©e Baroness Elisabeth von Plotho) is said to have inspired Effi Briest. [2]
The youngest of five children, Elisabeth was born in Zerben (currently known as Elbe-Parey ) in 1853. Her easeful life was cut short by her meeting Armand LÃ©on von Ardenne (1848-1919). She is said to have shown little interest in Ardenne; having rejected his first proposal, she changed her mind during the Franco-Prussian War , which left Ardenne injured. They became engaged on 7 February 1871 and wed in 1873.
His ascent made them move to DÃ¼sseldorf in the summer of 1881, where they met the famed and unhappily-married judge Emil Hartwich (1843-1886). Effi and Hartwich had much in common, like their love of theatre. They did not even cease corresponding when the Ardennes went back to Berlin on 1 October 1884.
Hartwich would come irregularly. During the summer of 1886, which Hartwich spent in Berlin, he and Elisabeth chose to marry each other. But Ardenne saw his secret suspicions confirmed when he found Effiâ€™s and Hartwichâ€™s year-long correspondence. He filed for divorce and duelled Hartwich on 27 November 1886, drawing strong coverage. Hartwich died from his injuries on 1 December. Ardenne was sentenced to two years in prison before seeing his term sink to 18 days.
His divorce on 15 March 1887 gave him full custody of his children, and his ex-wife set about caring for the deprived and disabled. Her name was temporarily removed from the family chronicles. In 1904, her daughter Margot was the first to try and find her; her son Egmont saw her in 1909. She died in Lindau on 4 February 1952 and was interred in a Berlin Ehrengrab .
Fiction and truth
Fontane changed myriad details so as not to imperil their privacy. He also made changes for the sake of drama. Elisabeth married at age 19 instead of 17, with Ardenne being five and not twenty years her senior. She fell in love with Hartwich after twelve years â€“ not twelve months â€“ of marriage, and Ardenne did not kill her paramour years after the dalliance, but when they were still courting. Fontane knew that Elisabeth did not retreat like Effi; instead, she began to work and devote herself to the needy. Elisabeth died at 98; Effi dies at 29.
Some dates were altered, too. Effi marries on 3 October; Elisabeth wed on 1 January. Effi bears Annie on 3 July, while Margotâ€™s birthday was 5 November; Egmontâ€™s was 4 January. [3] Elisabeth was born on 26 October; Effi has an August birthday.
Legacy
Today Effi Briest is widely discussed and taught at German schools. It has greatly influenced German writers, including Thomas Mann in his creation of Buddenbrooks .[ citation needed ]
