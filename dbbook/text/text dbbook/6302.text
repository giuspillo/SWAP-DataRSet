An Autobiography also known as Toward Freedom, (1936) is an autobiographical book written by the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru while he was in prison. It ran nine editions in the first year alone. He wrote the book to explore how and why he had ended up taking the path of civil disobedience that in turn led to his imprisonment. Nehru starts his history with how his ancestors had to flee Kashmir, and then goes on to tell about his own life, with a particular emphasis on the parts of his life that had brought him to this point in time. His entire life history, from even before his father was born, seems to have led him naturally to where he was. As a child he seems quiet, observing, and thoughtful. As a (very tall) grownup he is still thoughtful. One sees his admiration for humble people, and his aversion to any form of violence very early in the book.
