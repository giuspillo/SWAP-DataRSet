"One new twist on elves is self-sufficiency and nonspecialization," Skip Williams explained. "The long elven lifespan gives them plenty of time for learning to do things for themselves. Halflings lead something of a double life. Their wandering lifestyle obliges them to seem open and welcome to strangers, but they have secrets they keep to themselves." [1]
