Polaroids from the Dead is a collection of short stories and essays by Douglas Coupland. The theme is that each story is written from a collection of old polaroids Coupland found in a drawer. It is an attempt to describe the 1990s, a decade that "seemed to be living in a 1980s hangover". Topics of the stories include a Grateful Dead concert (source of "The Dead" in title), a post-mortem letter to Kurt Cobain, Vancouver's Lions Gate Bridge, and an homage to James Rosenquist's painting F-111. The book's ends with a longer essay on Brentwood, California, home to Marilyn Monroe's grave, and the O. J. Simpson murder case. The essay is in part a collage of menus, scraps of conversation, and postings from bulletin boards.
Synopsis
The book is split into three parts. The first part is Polaroids from the Dead, which is a collection of short stories inspired by a series of Grateful Dead concerts. The second is Portraits of People and Places, which is a collection of essays about people and places, including a letter to Kurt Cobain and a discussion of the Lions Gate Bridge. The last part is called â€œBrentwood Notebookâ€� and is a discussion of Brentwood, California, a suburb of Los Angelus. It is also where Marilyn Monroe died, and where Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered.
Part One: Polaroids from the Dead
The first part contains ten fictional stories. They have titles like â€œThe 1960s Are Disneylandâ€�, and "T or F: Self-Perfection Is Attainable Within Your Lifetime."

Interspersed within the text are large, full-page images of the Polaroids that inspired the story. Other images include a picture of Sharon Tate and Charles Manson, in reference to their mention in a story.

Inspiration
Coupland discusses his influences in writing this book in the introduction called â€œKitchen Drawer Filled with Photosâ€�. He discusses the stories from the past that he collected in this book. The stories in the Polaroids section were experienced at a series of Grateful Dead concerts in December 1991. Jerry Garcia had already died when the book was published in 1996.
â€œThis book is mainly an examination of people and places I found fascinating (for whatever reasons we develop fascinations) duringâ€� the period from 1991 to 1994.
â€” Coupland on Polaroids focus [1]
The Super Tuesday stories were researched by Coupland during the Super Tuesday primaries in 1992.
The Brentwood Notebook was written in 1994 over the course of one day on the thirty second anniversary of Marilyn Monroeâ€™s death. It was also months after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. It was to be written a year before in a style like the Palo Alto article, but Coupland lacked a hook for the story.
