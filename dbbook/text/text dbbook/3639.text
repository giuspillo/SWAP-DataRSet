Nine Coaches Waiting is a suspense, Gothic Romance novel by Mary Stewart published originally in 1958. The novel tells the haunting tale of a young English governess, Belinda (known as "Linda") Martin, who travels to Château Valmy, near Thonon-les-Bains, France to take care of nine-year-old Philippe de Valmy. There she finds herself tangled in a plot to murder her ward and tries to save Philippe, which eventually results in many revelations of dark family secrets. Stewart includes chapter epigraphs quoting from Romeo and Juliet, by William Shakespeare, among other quotes that fit the themes or actions of each scene.
Synopsis
Linda Martin lands in Paris on a cold, gray, and rainy day. She is on her way to her new post as a governess to the young Count Philippe de Valmy. Linda has been orphaned, and quickly befriends Philippe, who has also lost both his parents in a tragic accident. The nine-year-old boy lives with his aunt and uncle in the vast and ornate ChÃ¢teau Valmy in the French countryside. LÃ©on de Valmy, Philippe's uncle, runs the estate on behalf of his underage nephew until he will come of age (textual evidence suggests that this will be at the age of 15) and arranged for a proper English governess for his charge. When Linda arrives at the imposing manor , she is at once enchanted by its beauty and history, but is also immediately struck by the sense of menace and doom surrounding the land and its inhabitants. LÃ©on is a charismatic force of nature and quite charming and, when Linda meets his reckless and rakishly handsome son Raoul, she understands a bit more about the de Valmy heritage and what makes this family tick. As she becomes closer to Philippe and Raoul, Linda draws ever nearer to putting her finger on the source of the threat. But the layers of danger and darkness run deeper than any of them guessed and she may not be able to trust those she wants to, no matter how innocent or attractive they may seem. Soon it is up to the shy young governess to beat the clock in order to save Philippe's life as well as her own.

Notes
The novel is divided into Nine parts or 9 Coaches. The title 'Nine Coaches Waiting' is derived from The Revenger's Tragedy -
Oh, think upon the pleasure of the palace:
Secured ease and state, the stirring meats,
Ready to move out of the dishes,
That e'en now quicken when they're eaten,
Banquets abroad by torch-light, musics, sports,
Bare-headed vassals that had ne'er the fortune
To keep on their own hats but let horns [wear] 'em,
Nine coaches waiting. Hurry, hurry, hurry!
