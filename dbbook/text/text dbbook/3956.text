King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table is a children's novel written by Roger Lancelyn Green. It was first published in Puffin Books in 1953 and has been frequently reprinted. In 2008, it was re-issued in the Puffin Classics series. This edition has an inspiring introduction by David Almond, and the original illustrations by Lotte Reiniger. The book's originality lies in its attempt to weave together the many legends surrounding King Arthur. Green claimed that Thomas Malory's version of the story, Le Morte d'Arthur, was a loose collection of separate stories. Green attempted to relate each legend so that the entire story would have a beginning, middle, and end. Green used many resources other than Thomas Malory when gathering the legends together.
