The Mystery of a Hansom Cab
The Mystery of a Hansom Cab was first published in Melbourne, Australia, in 1886, and subsequently published in Britain in 1887. [2] The author self-published the first edition of the novel. [1] [5] It was published in the United States in 1888 by G. Munro. [17] Hume wrote an introduction to a revised edition published in 1898. [2] Later publications have included New York publishers Arno Press in 1976, [18] and Dover in 1982. [19] A new Australian edition with an introduction by Simon Caterson was published in 1999 by The Text Publishing Company and has been reprinted several times. [20]
Sales
The book was successful in sales with publishers; it sold 25,000 copies in its first print run in Australia, [3] and in its first two print runs in Australia the book sold 100,000 copies. [15] In its first six months after publication in Britain, 300,000 copies were sold. [2] [14] In 1888, sales continued heavily in the thousands in Britain each week. [2] [14] According to A Gregarious Culture (2001), "sales of The Mystery of a Hansom Cab, published in 1886, would reach astronomical figures". [6] Over 500,000 copies were sold in Britain, by the publishing company Jarrod. [15] An additional 500,000 copies sold in the United States. [5] A Concise History of Australia notes that the book became an "international bestseller". [13] A Companion to Australian Literature since 1900 noted The Mystery of a Hansom Cab "provided Australia with its first international bestseller". [1] and Vintage Mystery and Detective Stories characterized the book as "the best-selling detective novel of the nineteenth century". [5]
The author did not benefit greatly from the sales of the work, as he had sold his rights to the book for GBÂ£ 50. [15] A Gregarious Culture identifies "the only known copy of the first edition" of the book as "a treasure" of the Mitchell Library at State Library of New South Wales . [6] Illustrated London News reported in 1888 on the popularity of the book, "Persons were found everywhere eagerly devouring the realistic sensational tale of Melbourne social life. Whether travelling by road, rail or river the unpretending little volume was ever present in some companion's or stranger's hands." [2] [14] The book outsold the worldwide 1887 publication of the Sherlock Holmes novel A Study in Scarlet by Arthur Conan Doyle . [1]
"The most spectacular reimagining of the sensation novel"
 â€”A Companion to Crime Fiction [2]
A Companion to Crime Fiction (2010) by Charles J. Rzepka and Lee Horsley called The Mystery of a Hansom Cab "The most spectacular reimagining of the sensation novel , and a crucial point in the genre's transformation into detective fiction". [2] A History of the Book in Australia 1891-1945 (2001) described the book as, "a lively and engaging crime novel which used its Melbourne setting to considerable effect." [3] Geoffrey Blainey wrote in A History of Victoria that The Mystery of a Hansom Cab, "did more than any book to give the outside world a picture of Melbourne of the late 1880s". [4] David Stuart Davies featured the work in his book Vintage Mystery and Detective Stories, writing, "The author was determined to make a fortune by creating a story 'containing a mystery, a murder, and a description of low life in Melbourne'. He succeeded. Like a rich plum in our vintage mystery pudding we include the whole novel in this collection." [5]
