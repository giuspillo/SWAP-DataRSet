The Troubled Man
Before the Frost (Innan Frosten) is a novel by Swedish crime-writer Henning Mankell .
The main protagonist is Linda Wallander , daughter of Inspector Wallander . The book was to be the first in a three-book series with Linda as the main character. However Mankell abandoned the series after just one novel when the actress playing Linda in the Swedish films, Johanna SÃ¤llstrÃ¶m , committed suicide in 2007. [1]
Adaptations
A feature film adaptation directed by Kjell-Ã…ke Andersson was made in 2004 and released in Swedish cinemas on 14 January 2005. It stars Johanna SÃ¤llstrÃ¶m as Linda and Krister Henriksson as Kurt. The film also serves as the opening installment of Mankell's Wallander , a series of theatrical and straight-to-video films based on story outlines by Mankell but otherwise unconnected to the novels. SÃ¤llstrÃ¶m and Henriksson reprise their roles in these films.
The BBC filmed the novel for the British television adaptation of Mankell's Wallander novels, but they rewrote the story to make Wallander the protagonist, with Kenneth Branagh playing the role of Kurt Wallander.
A stage adaptation authorized by Mankell was premiered at the Westphalia State Theatre in Paderborn , Germany, in 2006.
