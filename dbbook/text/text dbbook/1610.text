The Stone Raft is a novel by Nobel Prize in Literature-winning Portuguese writer José Saramago. It first appeared in Portuguese in 1986, and was translated into English in 1994. The basic premise of the novel is that the Iberian Peninsula has broken off the European continent and is floating freely in the Atlantic Ocean; bureaucrats around the world are forced to deal with the traumatic effects, while five characters from across Portugal and Spain are drawn ever closer to one another, embarking on a journey within the peninsula as the landmass journeys itself. It was made into a film that was released in 2002 and was called La Balsa de Piedra (the Spanish translation of the Portuguese title of Saramago's novel). It was directed by acclaimed Dutch director George Sluizer and the film was a Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese co-production.
