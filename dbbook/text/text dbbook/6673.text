The Beast Master is a science fiction novel by Andre Norton, first published in 1959.
Plot
The Beast Master tells of Hosteen Storm, a Navajo [2] and former soldier who has empathic and telepathic connections with a group of genetically altered animals. The team emigrates from Earth to the distant planet Arzor where it is hired to herd livestock. Storm still harbors anger at his former enemies the Xik, and has sworn revenge on a man named Quade for his father's murder. According to Kirkus he finds "life and hope" instead. [2]
In this novel and its sequels Norton explores aspects of Native American culture, specifically the Navajo, through metaphors in Storm's life and in the culture he adopts on his new home world.
Reception
Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale received the novel favorably, saying that "young readers are sure to enjoy complete enthrallment." [6]
Kirkus Reviews concluded that the "fantasy is made convincing by the author's boldness of imagination and by his ability to yield totally to the atmosphere which he creates." [2] This was one of several reviews by Kirkus from 1958 to 1963 which reveal that the reviewer presumed "Andre Norton" to be a man. Some others were The Time Traders and its three sequels.
In Norton's sequel Lord of Thunder (1962), Hosteen Storm discovers and resolves a problem with stakes on a world scale. Kirkus concluded that that story "is secondary to the fascinating description, the imaginative ideas, and the general quality of prose and dialogue. For the experienced science-fiction reader." [7]
Kirkus welcomed the continuation of the series by Norton and Lyn McConchie in Beast Master's Ark (Tor, 2002), including the promise of a fourth installment. "[T]hat's good, since this is one of the better SF series going, with Norton using stripped prose to put her stereotypes through their foredestined rounds. ... Neat, swift, and strongly detailed. Old fans will dance and howl for more." [8] McConchie claims to be sole author of the prose. [4]
Adaptations
Ideas from the novel were featured in a 1982 film, The Beastmaster , which did not significantly follow the novel's plot.[ citation needed ]
From 1999 to 2002, a Canadian television series, BeastMaster , was produced which again used concepts and characters from the novel but did not follow its plot or setting.[ citation needed ]
