Reception
Reviewing the book for the New York Times , Thomas Mallon said: "Combining actual and invented figures requires a particular sleight of hand, and in The Magician's Wife Moore accomplishes this mingling without giving any glimpse of a false bottom or secret compartment... The Magician's Wife, combining so many of Moore's longtime preoccupations and themes, proves to be one of his neatest tricks yet." [3] The San Francisco Chronicle described it as a "deft and absorbing novel". [4]
