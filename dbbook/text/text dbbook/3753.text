Plot summary
Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin are in Paris . Modesty is being wined and dined by RenÃ© Vaubois, head of the French DeuxiÃ¨me Bureau (the French Intelligence Service), on a floating restaurant on the Seine . RenÃ© asks Modesty for advice regarding a new protection racket. High-level people all over the world are receiving death threats, and those who don't pay end up dead. The really crazy thing is that most of the deaths are apparently natural deaths.
Willie, waiting on the river bank for Modesty's return, encounters Chuli, a criminal whose specialty is planting bombs. RenÃ© Vaubois' car has been wired with explosives. And when Modesty, Willie, RenÃ© and Stephen Collier (making his first appearance) leave the scene they are followed by a car full of underworld killers, all bent on putting RenÃ© down.
This is the start of a rather strange story about Lucifer and a pair of elderly puppeteers, Seth and Regina. Seth and Regina have turned to crime after being unable to get work when the music halls closed down. Now Seth has created an incredible worldwide protection racket based on Lucifer's ability to accurately predict impending deaths.
The action heats up when Modesty is taken prisoner and a radio-controlled cyanide capsule is surgically implanted under her skin. The final confrontation takes place on a remote island near Indonesia . First Modesty and Willie are forced to fight a duel to the death against each other. Later the machine guns are blazing in a major battle between the good guys and the bad guys, with Modesty risking everything to try to save Lucifer.
