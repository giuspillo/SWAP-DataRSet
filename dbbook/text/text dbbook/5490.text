American Empire: The Center Cannot Hold is the second book in the American Empire alternate history series by Harry Turtledove. It takes place during the period of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression (specifically from 1924 to March 4, 1934). During this era in Turtledove's Southern Victory Series world, the Confederate States of America, stretching from Sonora to Virginia, is led by Whigs (with fascists gaining more and more power) while the United States of America (which has been occupying Canada) is controlled by socialists.
Plot summary
During the period, the U.S. shares world domination with Germany (now victors of the Great War ) while the C.S.A. faces poverty and national calamity. Much like Adolf Hitler and his rise to power in real-life 1930s Germany, an antagonist named Jake Featherston rides a fascist wave to power in this desperate Confederacy of the Great Depression. The Americans seem to care little about the activities of the Confederates until it is too late and it seems the road is leading the U.S.A. and C.S.A. toward a fourth war (after facing one another in the War of Secession , the Second Mexican War , and the Great War ).
Cover
