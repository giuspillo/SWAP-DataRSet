The Wonderful O is the last of James Thurber’s 5 short-book fairy tales for children. See also Many Moons, (1943) The Great Quillow (1944), The White Deer (1945), The 13 Clocks (1950). It was published in 1957 by Hamish Hamilton / Simon Schuster. Thurber died in 1961. As well as constant, complex wordplay, Thurber uses other literary devices such as frequent internal meter or rhythmic prose, near-poetry, puns, literary allusions (e. g to wandering minstrels) and thus creates a humorous satire involving loss, love and freedom. The Wonderful O uses a form of constrained writing or lipogram where the letter O is omitted at the demands of the villains. “I’ll build you a better man of firmer flesh and all complete, from hairy head to metatarsal feet, using A’s and I’s and U’s and E’s with muscular arms and flexible knees; eyes and ears and lids and lips, neck and chest and breast and hips; … ” It was one of several of Thurber's works illustrated by his friend and frequent illustrator Marc Simont after Thurber went blind during the 1950s. The 2009 reprint by The New York Review Children's Collection, has the original illustrations by Marc Simont. The Penguin edition (1962) was joined with the 13 Clocks and both stories were illustrated by Ronald Searle.
