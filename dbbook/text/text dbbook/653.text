The Eagle and the Raven was written by James A. Michener. Drawings by Charles Shaw. It was published by State House Press of Austin Texas in 1990. State House Press was owned in part by a former secretary of Mr. Michener. Originally the fourth chapter of Michener's novel "Texas". The Eagle and the Raven was deleted, but then published separately at the insistence of Debbie Brothers, a former secretary of Mr. Michener's. It is a character study of the two dominant figures from the opposing sides of the separation of Texas from Mexico, Sam Houston (the raven) and Antonio López de Santa Anna (the eagle). Their somewhat similar and parallel careers, and their lives, are well portrayed. While somewhat similar, the two men are also very contrasting. Their only battle (and their only meeting), the 1836 Battle of San Jacinto, the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution, is one of the events narrated in depth. As an added benefit, the book begins with a 32-page autobiographical prologue, which gives details and reasons for Mr. Michener's explosion of productivity in the last decade of his life.
