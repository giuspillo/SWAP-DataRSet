The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes is a short story collection of Sherlock Holmes pastiches written by Adrian Conan Doyle and John Dickson Carr, first published in 1954. As an early and rather authoritative example of Sherlockian pastiche—the collaborators being the son and the authorised biographer of Holmes's creator—there is much to interest collectors.
" The Adventure of the Red Widow "
The collaboration was not smooth, as Douglas G.Greene relates in John Dickson Carr: The Man Who Explained Miracles. There is some doubt about who wrote whatâ€”though at times Carr's highly recognisable style breaks through the convention of pastiching the original Conan Doyle stories.[ citation needed ]
Parallels to canonical stories are uncomfortably close sometimes. The stated intention of expanding the tantalising references Doyle made to unwritten cases did not work out, and the new stories often have to abridge those references, or quote them selectively, or explain them away.
In 1963 John Murray published two paperback volumes which divided the stories into The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes by Adrian Conan Doyle and More Exploits of Sherlock Holmes by Adrian Conan Doyle and John Dickson Carr. The first title contains the last six stories listed above, the second the first six. Greene suggests that authorship may be more complex.[ citation needed ]
