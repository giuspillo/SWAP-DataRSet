Plot summary
Set in West Palm Beach and Miami , FL, Rum Punch follows Jackie Burke, a 44-year-old airline stewardess , who has been bringing cash into the country for a gunrunner named Ordell Robbie (whose nickname, Whitebread , comes from the fact that he's a light-skinned African-American ). When the cops try to use Jackie to get at Ordell, she hatches a planâ€”with help from bail bondsman Max Cherryâ€”to keep the money for herself.
