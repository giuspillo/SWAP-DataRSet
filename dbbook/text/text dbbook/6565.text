Main article: Jesse Stone: Death in Paradise
There are many significant differences in the film. First off, Jesse is haunted by dreams of Billie trapped underwater throughout the film, while there is no mention of nightmares in the novel. Furthermore, in the film Jesseâ€™s only contact with Jenn is by phone. She does refer him to Dr. Dix, but Jesse insists on discussing cases with him and does not stop drinking. Also since this film was made after Stone Cold, Abby Taylorâ€™s murder is referenced. Jesse struggles with guilt over her death and is shown visiting her grave.
The main plot differs significantly. In the film, Shaw is framed for Billieâ€™s murder by a man named Leo Finn. Alan Garner is not involved in the plot at all. In the film, Shaw is writing an unflattering expose on Finn. In an attempt to prevent this, he has his Henchman Lovey Norris murder Billie Bishop. Shaw later tells Jesse that he had fallen in love with Billie who was pregnant with his child. Jesse confronts Finn and Norris with this information in a warehouse. Norris responds by trying to shoot Jesse, but Jesse shields himself with Finnâ€™s body and Norris accidentally kills him. Jesse then draws his weapon and kills Norris. A final significant difference is the fact that Suitcase Simpson is shot in the head during the standoff with Snyder. The film ends with Suitcase in a coma.
