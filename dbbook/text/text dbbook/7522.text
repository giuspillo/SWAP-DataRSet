The Bloody Sun is a science fiction novel by Marion Zimmer Bradley in her Darkover book series. It was first published by Ace Books in 1964. The novel was substantially rewritten, expanded, and republished under the same title in 1979; Bradley's short story "To Keep the Oath" was included in this edition and all subsequent reprintings.
Plot Summary
Damon Ridenow learns that Leonie Hastur, Keeper of Arilinn, has died. His daughter, Cleindori (Dorilys Aillard, daughter of Jaelle nâ€™ha Melora) arrived with Kennard Alton in tow. She has decided to go to Arilinn to train as their Keeper. Ridenow objects, but canâ€™t talk her out of her decision.
About forty years later, Jefferson Andrew Kerwin, age 29, arrives on Darkover. He knows that he was born there, and spent his first ten years in the Spacemanâ€™s Orphanage. In the Trade City, he meets Ragan, who identifies a blue crystal that Jeff wears as a matrix. He is mistaken by several Darkovan natives for a member of the Comyn aristocracy.
Jeff tries staring into his matrix crystal and hears voices saying that he must find his way, unaided. Defying orders, he follows his instincts into the Old Town. He arrives at the Alton townhouse and meets Kennard Alton, Taniquel, and Auster. They tell him he has passed a test for laran.
Kennard tells Jeff that his motherâ€™s name was Cleindori and his father was Terran; that after she was murdered, Jeff was put in the orphanage for his own safety, but he had been sent to Earth before his relations could reclaim him. [1]
Jeff meets Elorie of Arilinn and the other members of Arilinn Tower. Kennard explains the basics of Darkovan society and Tower functioning. The tower circle accepts Jeff, except for Auster, who remains hostile. Jeff remains for training.
The tower performs some mining experiments, only to have their claims jumped by the Aldarans. Austur believes it to be a Terran trick. They form a circle to identify the spy. It turns out to be Ragan, the weaselly man Jeff met his first night in the Trade City. Jeff claims vengenance, but the attempt to capture Ragan fails.
Jeff decides to leave Arilinn, and Elorie, who has fallen in love with him, decides to go with him. The other members of the tower react with horror, indicating that Cleindoriâ€™s work is far from finished. They go to the spaceport for safety. Jeff and Elorie marry, but are unable to leave Darkover for legal reasons.
Elorie uses her Keeperâ€™s training to probe Jeffâ€™s memories of the death of his mother. He discovers that he is the son, not of Jefferson Kerwin, but of Lewis-Arnad Lanart-Alton. He also realises that Auster and Ragan are twins, the true children of Jefferson Kerwin, by Cassilda Lanart-Ridenow.
The couple seeks help from Dyan Ardais, Elorieâ€™s half brother to obtain an audience with Lord Hastur. Hastur admits that he should have done more to protect Cleindori, and her father, Damon Ridenow, saying he will not make the same mistake with Elorie. He listens to her story.
Unable to contact Arilinn to warn them about the threat posed by the unsuspected link between Auster and Ragan, Jeff and Elorie ride to Arilinn. They are able to exclude Ragan from the circle and complete their task. Elorie is injured, but survives.
Jeff tells the circle that the experience proves Cleindori was right â€“ that matrix mechanics are a science, not a mystical art, and that a keeper need not be a cloistered virgin. Jeff remains on Darkover, now accepted into the families of the Comyn.

Inconsistencies with other books in the series
Jeffâ€™s parents are identified in this book as Cleindori Aillard and Lewis Lanart-Alton. Elorie pieces together his original name as Damon Aillard, since the Aillards rank the Altons. In Sharra's Exile , he names the same parents, identifying himself as Damon Lanart-Aillard (pg 111). However, in Exile's Song , Mikhal Lanart-Alton (pg 271) says his that his name is Damon Ridenow, and identifies his father as Arnad Ridenow. Arnad Ridenow is also identified as Jeff's father in the original 1964 version of The Bloody Sun and in The Darkover Concordance. [2]
Kennard says that marriage is a fairly recent development on Darkover (pg 258.) However, all of the Darkover books, including Stormqueen! , which represents the oldest story in the chronology, includes some version of monogamous marriage.
