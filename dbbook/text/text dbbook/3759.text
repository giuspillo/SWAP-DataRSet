Plot
"Without wanting to, I have committed the perfect crime: nobody saw me coming, except for the victim. The proof, I am still free." The whole story takes place at an airport's hall: JÃ©rÃ´me Angust, a man on a business trip, waits for a delayed flight. He meets another "cosmetic" man, Textor Texel, who becomes his executioner and keeps harassing him till the end, in a dialogue worthy of HygiÃ¨ne de l'assassin .
