Takao Kasuga (æ˜¥æ—¥ é«˜ç”·, Kasuga Takao ? )
Portrayed and Voiced by: Shin'ichirÅ� Ueda
A middle school student who has a huge love for literature and a crush on Saeki. Upon seeing her gym clothes while alone in the classroom, Kasuga is unable to resist and begins scenting them, but then panics after hearing something and impulsively steals the girl's clothes. He soon discovers that his sinful act was witnessed by Sawa Nakamura, an isolated loner in his class who blackmails him into forming a contract, tying them as "friends". He many times has to bear the shame of her demands, but also acting on his own, begins to date Saeki herself, much to Nakamura's dismay. While initially disliking her requests and their meetings, Kasuga soon feels attracted to her personality, and realises that Nakamura is actually lonely, longing to escape from the people of the town, much like himself. He develops strong feelings for her, promising to one day take her to the "other side". However, this causes him to break up with Saeki and hurt her feelings, which in turn brings a series of unfortunate events led by Nakamura's and Kasuga's schemes that increasingly cause havoc to their school, and soon enough, the whole town, Saeki's unwillingness to give up on him and the bare truth behind each person's character, a combination that eventually builds up until he is unable to control them.
Three years after the summer festival incident, Kasuga has moved to ÅŒmiya to restart his life. However, his family is now broken because of his past actions, himself becoming distant to his parents and society, and even losing the will to engage in literature. While having a few friends, he is quite reserved to the point of becoming awkward. One day, disillusioned with life and the parting with Nakamura, he encounters a colleague from school, Aya Tokiwa, purchasing Les Fleurs du mal in a bookstore, which leads to his return to the books, always lent by her. Despite having a boyfriend, Kasuga becomes closer to Tokiwa, acting as an editor to her amateur novel, whose plot instigated and helped him bring up his resolve to actually restart his life and fix the mistakes he made. He manages to bring her to his side, promising to "kill her ghosts", and starts to date her. While sharing a good relationship after becoming lovers, Kasuga fears Tokiwa's interest in his hometown and refuses to go back there with her.
Sawa Nakamura (ä»²æ�‘ ä½�å’Œ, Nakamura Sawa ? )
Portrayed by: Minami Sasaki
Voiced by: Mariya Ise
A classmate of Kasuga who sits behind him in classroom. She is considered by others as a strange, lonely and isolated girl, and reportedly has no friends. She shows no reaction to other people, and while remaining calm and apparently sane, she tends to talk back to others, calling people shit eaters. She is the sole witness to Kasuga's breakdown upon facing Saeki's gym clothes and, having knowledge of this fact, she blackmails him into becoming his "friend" if he doesn't want to let the school know his sin. She repeatedly calls Kasuga a "sick minded" person, vows to "peel off all of his skin" and forces him into shameful and torturous situations, displaying a sadistic personality. Nakamura has emotional outbursts when expressing herself to Kasuga, the only one aware of this weak side of hers, which leads him to deduce that her quaint behaviour is actually a demonstration of her desire to "escape" with him, ceasing to be alone and taking both "to the other side" of the mountains. Due to this, Kasuga learns to understand and earn Nakamura's admiration, and the two begin plotting together at one point of the story. However, Nakamura earnestly believes that even if Kasuga chooses to stay with her, she will ultimately be isolated.

Another girl from Kasuga's class, on whom he has a crush, Saeki is deemed as the top student of their class, and is considered to be a popular and beautiful girl. After he defends Nakamura from the rest of their class and supports him, Saeki begins to take an interest in Kasuga, especially his passion for Les Fleurs du mal and how he is able to show his true self, without having to hide his personality; desires or interests. The two start dating â€“ contrary to Nakamura's orders to Kasuga â€“ and Saeki reveals how she longs for a life in which she doesn't have to fake herself with being well-mannered, composed and focused on study. For this, she becomes determined to understand Kasuga better, but his increasing intimacy with Nakamura starts to make her jealous, and faced with a tough choice, Kasuga ultimately decides to side with Nakamura. While trying to win him back, she learns of Kasuga's and Nakamura's deeds, and becomes convinced that she corrupted the good person he once was. Obsessed with saving him from the evil acts of Nakamura, Saeki also begins to commit evil acts herself, mainly omitting her discoveries about the couple's schemes, but later unleashing her hatred over the bond Kasuga and Nakamura share, which eventually brings her disgrace.
Kasuga easily recognises Saeki in the city by her scent, which he has grown used to after stealing her clothes, on an occasion three years later. She now lives in Utsunomiya , has gotten a new boyfriend who, according to Tokiwa, "looks a lot" like Kasuga and later asks for the latter's e-mail. The two arrange to meet again and discuss the events from their pasts and what followed after the summer festival. Upon learning that Kasuga doesn't know about Nakamura's whereabouts, she toys with his emotions and reveals to be disappointed by his inertia and hypocrisy in life.

She accidentally reveals that not only she loves reading â€“ a secret kept from her friends and boyfriend â€“ but also dreams of writing a novel. She soon realises that Kasuga is the only one able to understand her, and also the only one she can relate to. At the promise of "killing her ghosts", she leaves Kouji and begins dating Kasuga, a relationship that becomes beneficial for both, as she is easily able to write her novel and he makes up with his parents. Tokiwa truly cares for Kasuga, and wishes to continue living with him on to university, but suspects he hides something from his past, as he irreducibly refuses her request for both to visit his hometown back in Gunma. Saeki notices Tokiwa's resemblance with Nakamura, and suggests she is only a replacement for her, certain that Kasuga will "throw her away when it gets too annoying" as she "is not Nakamura".
