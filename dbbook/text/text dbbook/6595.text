The Feeling Good Handbook is a workbook written by David D. Burns , M.D. as a companion to his best-selling Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy . The Handbook includes a lucid explanation of principles of cognitive behavioral therapy which details ways to improve a person's mood and life by identifying and eliminating common cognitive distortions while improving communication skills . These explanations are combined with encouragement to the reader to carry out exercises in the cognitive and communication skills presented in each chapter.
The original 1989 Handbook was the subject of a randomized controlled trial (set out in the preface to the 1999 revised edition) in which patients who were provided a copy of the Handbook to read while on a waiting list to receive counseling for depression dramatically reduced their scores on depression tests compared to others on the same waiting list who received another, "placebo" book, or no treatment.
The revised edition was published in 1999 ( ISBN 978-0-452-28132-5 ).
