The One Minute Manager, a book by Ken Blanchard and Spencer Johnson. According to Blanchard's website, it has sold more than 13 million copies and has been translated into 37 languages. The brief volume tells a story, recounting three techniques of an effective manager: one-minute goals, one-minute praisings and one-minute reprimands. Each of these takes only a minute but is purportedly of lasting benefit.
