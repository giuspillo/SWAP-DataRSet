Journey to the End of Night (Voyage au bout de la nuit, 1932) is the first novel of Louis-Ferdinand Céline. This semi-autobiographical work describes antihero Ferdinand Bardamu. Bardamu is involved with World War I, colonial Africa, and post-World War I America (where he works for the Ford Motor Company), returning in the second half of the work to France, where he becomes a medical doctor and establishes a practice in a poor Paris suburb, the fictional La Garenne-Rancy. The novel also satirizes the medical profession and the vocation of scientific research. The disparate elements of the work are linked together by recurrent encounters with Léon Robinson, a hapless character whose experiences parallel, to some extent, those of Bardamu. Voyage au bout de la nuit is a nihilistic novel of savage, exultant misanthropy, combined, however, with cynical humour. Céline expresses an almost unrelieved pessimism with regard to human nature, human institutions, society, and life in general. Towards the end of the book, the narrator Bardamu, who is working at an insane asylum, remarks: …I cannot refrain from doubting that there exist any genuine realizations of our deepest character except war and illness, those two infinities of nightmare,"("…je ne peux m'empêcher de mettre en doute qu'il existe d'autres véritables réalisations de nos profonds tempéraments que la guerre et la maladie, ces deux infinis du cauchemar,") A clue to understanding Celine's Voyage is the trauma he suffered during his experience of the Great War 1914-1918. This is revealed by a study of biographical and literary research on Celine, histories of the war, diaries of his cavalry regiment, and literature on the trauma of war. Celine's experience of the war leads to "…the obsession, the recurrent anguish, the refusal, the delirium, the violence, the pacifism, the anti-Semitic aberration of the 30’s, [and and] his philosophy of life . . . ."
Literary style
CÃ©line's first novel is most remarkable perhaps for its style. CÃ©line makes extensive use of ellipsis and hyperbole . He writes with the flow of natural speech patterns and writes vernacular , while also employing more erudite elements. This influenced French literature considerably. The novel enjoyed popular success and a fair amount of critical acclaim when it was published during October 1932. Albert Thibaudet , perhaps the greatest of the entre-deux-guerres critics, said that during January 1933 it was still a common topic of conversation at dinner parties in Paris. [3]
Influence and legacy
Paolo Sorrentino 's 2013 film La Grande Belezza opens with a quote from Journey to the End of the Night.
Will Self has written that Journey to the End of the Night "is the novel, perhaps more than any other, that inspired me to write fiction". [4]
The song "End of the Night" by The Doors references this book, as it had a great influence on the work of Jim Morrison .
Kurt Vonnegut cited Journey as one of his influences in Palm Sunday , and Bardamu's misadventures appear to have influenced Joseph Heller 's Catch-22 .
Charles Bukowski makes reference to Journey in a number of his novels and short stories, and employs prose techniques borrowed from CÃ©line. Bukowski wrote in Notes of a Dirty Old Man that "CÃ©line was the greatest writer of 2000 years". [5]
The Xiu Xiu song "F.T.W." references the book.
The Charlotte Gainsbourg song "Voyage" also references the book's French and English titles.
In Jean-Luc Godard 's 1965 dystopian science fiction film Alphaville , protagonist Lemmy Caution dismisses a taxi driver's offer of route options to his destination by stating that he is on "a journey to the end of the night". The film depicts the use of poetry as a weapon against a sentient computer system.
Italian film director Sergio Leone was a fan of the novel and was considering a film adaptation in the 1960s.
The novel inspired the Israeli singer and songwriter Aya Korem to write a song called "Tania". It is a sad yet satirical song, and Journey is credited in the liner notes of the album.
Norwegian progressive metal band Green Carnation 's debut album, Journey to the End of the Night (2000), is a reference to CÃ©line's novel.
The title of noise/punk band Heroine Sheiks ' 2008 release Journey to the Edge of the Knife is a reference to the novel.
The movie Bringing out the Dead by Martin Scorsese contains a scene showing the book on a shelf in Frank Pierce's home.
