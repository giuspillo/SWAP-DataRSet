Simisola is a 1994 novel by British crime writer Ruth Rendell. It features her recurring detective Inspector Wexford, and is the 16th in the series. Though a murder mystery, the book also touches on the themes of racism and welfare dependency.
Plot summary

Critical reception
The Daily Courier wrote about the book: "...some of it gets tedious, especially when characters who do not consider themselves racists search themselves for racist traits". [1]
