Soldier of the Mist is a 1986 fantasy novel by Gene Wolfe published by Tor Books; it won the 1987 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, and was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel and the World Fantasy Award. The story is presented as the recovered diary of Latro, a Roman mercenary who fought for Xerxes at the Battle of Plataea. As a result of head injuries incurred during the battle, Latro suffers from both retrograde and anterograde amnesia; due to the former, he does not know his own name, and must accept that others call him "Latro" (meaning "soldier"); due to the latter, he has been given scrolls on which to write down recent events so that he may (in principle) "READ THIS EVERY MORNING". He has also developed the ability to see and interact with gods, ghosts, and mythological creatures; due to his amnesia, he does not know that this is unusual. Soldier of the Mist has two sequels, Soldier of Arete (1989) and Soldier of Sidon (2006); Mist and Arete are collected as Latro in the Mist.
