Reception
Josephine Fortune, writing for Mania Entertainment, disliked the artist's style of face and felt that the character designs were too similar to each other. However, she felt that the artist's style went well with the supernatural story. [1] Johanna Draper Carlson felt that "the concept was cute", but that the art style did not stand out and Carlson "skipped" reading some of the manga to avoid getting "bored". [2]
