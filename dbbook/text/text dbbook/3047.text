Batman: Year 100 is a four-issue American comic book mini-series starring Batman, published in 2006 by DC Comics. It was written and illustrated by Paul Pope and colored by José Villarrubia.
Plot
In the year 2039, Gotham City is very nearly a police state, its citizens subject to unwarranted search and seizure. The Gotham Police clash almost daily with Federal agents, who are pursuing the legendary "Batman." Captain Gordon, the grandson of the original Commissioner Gordon , is also trying to find Batman, and find out what he knows about the murder of a Federal agent.
It is unknown if the "Batman" of this series is intended to be Bruce Wayne or another man having taken Batman's mantle as the protector of Gotham City. His partner and protÃ©gÃ© is a dark-skinned teenager named Robin , who was apparently adopted by Batman in his youth, and also serves as the mechanic for the " Batmobile ", a high-tech motorcycle rather than a car. He also acts as a decoy for Batman by dressing as the Dark Knight himself when necessary, and refers to Batman as "boss". Unlike other incarnations of Robin in the comics, this version of the character bears the name as his real name instead of as an alias.
Collected editions
In 2007 , the four issues were collected and published as a trade paperback edition ( ISBN 1401211925 ). The trade paperback also includes Pope's " The Berlin Batman ", which was originally published in The Batman Chronicles #11. The story features a version of Batman that lived in the German Weimar Republic on the eve of World War II . Editor Lynda Barry wished to include an excerpt from Batman: Year 100 in The Best American Comics 2008 but was denied permission by DC Comics for unstated reasons. [1]
