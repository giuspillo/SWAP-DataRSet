The Very Persistent Gappers of Frip is short story writer George Saundersâ€™s first children's book.
Plot summary
The village of Frip, consisting of three shacks by the sea, relies entirely on the production and sale of goat's milk. The gappers, an unintelligent lifeform shaped like a spiky fish, crawl up from the sea and sit on the backs of the goats. The gappers are so excited about the goats that they emit a loud, high-pitched noise that never ceases. The families must pluck the gappers from the goats' backs and throw them back into the sea.
