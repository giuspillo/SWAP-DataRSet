Are You Dave Gorman? is the title of a stage show by the British documentary comedian Dave Gorman and the book of the same name, co-written by Gorman and Danny Wallace. The BBC television series The Dave Gorman Collection— Gorman's first television show—was based on the show. The original show was created for the 2000 Edinburgh Festival Fringe and was nominated for a prestigious Perrier award. An extended version of the show was taken to the West End, then to the Melbourne International Comedy Festival (where it was nominated for a Barry Award), the HBO US Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado (where it won the Jury Award for Best One Person Show) and finally to New York where it ran for more than three months and was named Best Comedy Show of 2001 by Time Out New York.
Evolution
The show originated following a drunken bet between Dave Gorman and his friend Danny Wallace. The bet was thus: Gorman claimed that he shared the name "Dave Gorman" with the assistant manager of East Fife F.C. and that there must be "loads" of others around. Wallace disagreed with him. So the two travelled to Methil (from London â€“ several hundred miles), with a polaroid camera, to meet the assistant manager, whose name was indeed Dave Gorman. More trips followed, to meet more Dave Gormans. During a trip to New York, Gorman applied somewhat arbitrary criteria to exclude one man from the list on the grounds that a metal plaque outside his offices showed his name as "B. David Gorman" (his justification for this â€“ given on his web forum â€“ was "You've got to have rules"). He did, however, count meeting an actor who had once played a character called Dave Gorman.
Initially the bet was fairly vague, but on the way to meet Dave Gormans numbers three and four, they debated what "loads" meant. Danny decided on one for every card in the deck . That is 54 (including jokers). They also try to keep within a distance of 300â€“500 miles per Dave Gorman (mpdg), because under 300 means the name was too common, whilst over 500 means it is too obscure.
Stage show
To aid the search, which by his own admission became scarily serious, Gorman created a stage-show about their travels that was also used to appeal for further Dave Gormans to come forward. The show was called Are You Dave Gorman?. This acquired something of a cult following and several people helped Dave in his quest, which he did eventually complete. (Five even changed their names by deed poll to Dave Gorman â€“ two of them women).
