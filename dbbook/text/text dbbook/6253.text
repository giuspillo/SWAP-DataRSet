Plot introduction
In this thriller, mathematical symbols are the key to a mysterious sequence of murders . Each new death that occurs is accompanied by a different mathematical shape, starting with a circle . This pure mathematical form heralds the death of Mrs Eagleton, the landlady of a young Argentine mathematician who narrates the story. It appears that the serial killer can be stopped only if somebody can decode the next symbol in the sequence. The mathematics graduate is joined by the leading Oxford logician Arthur Seldom on the quest to solve the cryptic clues. The book explains how hard it can be to solve math in a cryptic form.
