Allusions and references in The House of Arden
During their journeys into the past, the children encounter several historical events:
1807: Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom , the British military response , and the smuggling around Dymchurch Bay (called "Lymchurch" in the story)
ca. 1705: a visit from the "Chevalier St. George" (the Old Pretender ) during the reign of Queen Anne
1605: the Gunpowder Plot and a meeting with Sir Walter Raleigh in the Tower of London , from which the children escape using the same stratagem Lady Nithsdale would use in 1717
ca. 1535: a May Day celebration with Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII , with premonitions of Anne's execution.
The final episode, in which the children rescue their father from a lost civilization in South America, is reminiscent of the legends of El Dorado and other Cities of Gold .
