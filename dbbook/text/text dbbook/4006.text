Plot
Meet Will Kelly. English teacher. Film fan. King of sandwich construction. Still in love with The One, desperately searching for An-Other One. In his decrepit flat, Will's lifeline is the telephone. There's Alice (who remembers his birthday), Simon (who doesn't), Martina (the one-night stand), Kate (the previous tenant of his rented Archway fleapit) and of course Aggi - the inimitable Aggi. His Legendary Girlfriend. Or is she? Two men, three women and a donkey called Sandy... basically it's your classic love hexagon.
