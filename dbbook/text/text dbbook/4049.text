The book recounts the kidnapping, imprisonment, and eventual release of a handful of prominent figures in Colombia in the early 1990s by the MedellÃ­n Cartel , a drug cartel founded and operated by Pablo Escobar .
The book begins with an account of the abductions of Maruja PachÃ³n and Beatriz Villamizar de Guerrero the evening of 7 November 1990. [1] People presume that Maruja was kidnapped because her sister is Gloria PachÃ³n , widow of the journalist and New Liberalism founder Luis Carlos GalÃ¡n . Beatriz is Maruja's sister-in-law and her personal assistant.
The book then examines the first in a series of related kidnappings. On 30 August 1990, Diana Turbay , director of the TV news program CriptÃ³n and magazine Hoy x Hoy , was abducted along with four members of her news team. They include editor Azucena LiÃ©vano , writer Juan Vitta , and camera operators Richard Becerra and Orlando Acevedo . German journalist Hero Buss was also with them when they were taken. Turbay is the daughter of former Colombian president and Liberal Party leader Julio CÃ©sar Turbay .
The kidnappings on 18 September 1990 of Marina Montoya and Francisco Santos CalderÃ³n , editor in chief of El Tiempo newspaper, are also recounted.

"If you want to understand my situation, read Gabriel Garcia Marquez 's News of a Kidnapping", Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi was quoted as having said in a meeting with his daughters in September 2011. Musavi, together with his wife, Zahra Rahnavard , has been under house arrest since February 2011. [2] After a week, some Persian book reference websites reported that News of a Kidnapping was among the best-selling "rare books" in Iran . [3]
