Reception
The book was well-received, winning a National Parenting Publications Award in 2006. [1] Steve Johnson of the Wichita Eagle declared, "Willems has written a unique story every bit as good as the classic Danny and the Dinosaur . His illustrations are playful with bright colors and bold expressions." [2] Lana Berkowitz of the Houston Chronicle called it "a winner", [3] while The Courier-Journal 's Jill Johnson Keeney said it was a "worthy successor" to Willems' earlier books, such as Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! and Knuffle Bunny: A Cautionary Tale . [4]
"Hoobie-Doobie"
Explaining Reginald's last name to an interviewer, Willems said, "'Hoobie-Doobie' is my generic fill-in for when I can't think of a word (as in 'Hand me the Hoobie-Doobie, please.'). Because I consistently blank on the English language, it's a phrase that is heard quite a bit around the house. My editor always giggles when I use the phrase, so I plopped it in as a place-holder when I pitched the story." [5]
