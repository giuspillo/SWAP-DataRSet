Plot summary
Israelâ€™s Prime Minister reinstates Ari Shamron as its director. Shortly thereafter, Israelâ€™s ambassador is murdered in Paris. The crime has all of the markings of Tariq al-Hourani, a terrorist mastermind.
Gabriel spearheaded a team that located and killed the operatives in the â€œMunich Massacre.â€� Seventeen years later, Tariq took vengeance upon Gabrielâ€”family member for family memberâ€”by planting a bomb under the Allonsâ€™ car in Vienna. Gabriel witnessed his familyâ€™s horrifying destruction. His son Dani died instantly, while his wife Leah was left with a shattered mind and body.
Nine years later, Gabriel has cut ties with the Office, secreted himself in Southern England, and poured himself into his other profession as an art restorer. Ari Shamron shows up on his doorstep. Shamron explains that he wants to assassinate Tariq but lacks support from the departmental directors at the Office. As a result, he urges Gabriel to spearhead a secret assassination operation. He accepts Shamronâ€™s plan and begins surveillance of Yusef, a member of Tariqâ€™s closely knit organization.
Gabriel decides that he needs to set Yusef up with a female operative. He handpicks Jacqueline Delacroix (nÃ©e Sarah HalÃ©vy), a French supermodel. Jacqueline has previously assisted three Office operations; in one of these, she worked closely with Gabriel and the two had an affair. Gabriel is careful to keep his interactions with Jacqueline to a mere professional familiarity. Jacqueline discovers that Gabriel still grieves over their affair, for its unmasking made Leah decide to accompany Gabriel on the fateful operation to Vienna.
Realizing that her modeling career is declining and unfulfilling, Jacqueline accepts Gabrielâ€™s role for her and seduces Yusef. Although this allows Gabriel to bug Yusefâ€™s apartment, it likewise blows Jacquelineâ€™s cover, for Yusef finds her making imprints of his keys and later sees Gabriel in his building. Gabriel is very concerned with Jacquelineâ€™s safety and therefore tries to pull her from the operation. Shamron, however, insists that her identity as Dominique Bonard is secure and insists that Gabriel continue the plan.
Meanwhile, Yusef warns Tariq that Gabriel is searching for him. Tariq designs a plan where Jacqueline must prove her professed love for Yusef by accompanying Tariq on a supposedly diplomatic mission to the United States. Indeed, Tariq recognizes Jacqueline from previous Office operations and suspects that he can use her as bait to lure Gabriel to his death. A conspiratorial relationship between Yusef and Uzi Navot, a major agent for the Office in Europe, also becomes apparent. Navot is one of the few Office operatives who knows about Shamronâ€™s secret plot.
Shortly after Jacqueline begins this â€˜diplomaticâ€™ trip, she realizes that her identity and security have been compromised. Gabriel believes that he has the upper hand in the arrangement until Tariq consistency eludes him and then disappears. Tariq smuggles Jacqueline through QuÃ©bec and into New York City, where he intends to make his last stand. The new PM of Israel and Yasser Arafat are in NYC that weekend to celebrate a momentous step towards creating peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. Too late, Gabriel realizes that Tariqâ€™s target is Arafat and not Israelâ€™s PM; Gabriel hastily alerts Arafat by phone just as the disguised Tariq zones in on the kill. Arafat the diplomat calmly recounts his love for Tariq, a former associate, and urges the assassin to abandon his design. Tariq decides to let Arafat live just as Gabriel and the escaped Jacqueline arrive on the scene. Tariq shoots Gabriel in the chest, but Jacqueline pursues and kills the would-be assassin.
Gabriel recovers from his wound in Israel, where Jacqueline has been forced to relocate due to media coverage of the event. One day, Gabriel spots Yusef in a local market and questions him at gunpoint. Yusef admits that he was working for Shamron as a double agent, and that Shamron had concocted the whole plot so Gabriel could finish off Tariq. When an angry Gabriel confronts Shamron, the wizened director is unapologetic and insists that it was both necessary to kill Tariq and just to have the killer be Gabriel.
Once his recovery is complete, Gabriel returns to his life in southern England as an art restorer.
Critical reception
Rebecca Ascher-Walsh writing for Entertainment Weekly gave the novel a "B+," describing it as "pure political popcorn." [2] According to Amazon.com , The New Yorker says that Silva "may never get around to plumbing his characters' souls, but he's having such a good time that we're content just to watch him play." [3] Randy Signor was less flattering and lamented that Silva's "promising career has now veered toward the predictable and slightly silly." [4]
