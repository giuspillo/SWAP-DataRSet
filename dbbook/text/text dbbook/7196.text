Cakes and Ale: or, the Skeleton in the Cupboard is a novel by British author William Somerset Maugham. Maugham exposes the misguided social snobbery leveled at the character Rosie Driffield (Edward's first wife), whose frankness, honesty and sexual freedom make her a target of conservative propriety. Her character is treated favourably by the book's narrator, Ashenden, who understands her sexual energy to be a muse to the many artists who surround her. Maugham drew his title from the remark of Sir Toby Belch to Malvolio in William Shakespeare's Twelfth Night: "Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?" Cakes and ale are the emblems of the good life in the tagline to the fable attributed to Aesop, "The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse": "Better beans and bacon in peace than cakes and ale in fear". It is one of two books to take the same quote for a title, the other being by Edward Spencer Mott. In 1958 Maugham stated in a CBC interview that Cakes and Ale was his favourite of all his novels.

Memorable quotes
William Ashenden: "It must be that there is something naturally absurd in a sincere emotion, though why there should be I cannot imagine, unless it is that man, the ephemeral inhabitant of an insignificant planet, with all his pain and all his striving is but a jest in an eternal mind" (286).
Alroy Kear: "You don't know America as well as I do. . . .They always prefer a live mouse to a dead lion" (279).
William Ashenden: "On his advice I read The Craft of Fiction by Mr Percy Lubbock , from which I learned that the only way to write novels was like Henry James ; after that I read Aspects of the Novel by Mr E M Forster , from which I learned that the only way to write novels was like Mr E M Forster; then I read The Structure of the Novel by Mr Edwin Muir , from which I learned nothing at all."
Mrs Hudson: â€˜Donâ€™t talk to me about the country. The doctor said I was to go there for six weeks last summer. It nearly killed me, I give you my word. The noise of it. All them birds singinâ€™ all the time, and the cocks crowinâ€™ and the cows mooinâ€™. I couldnâ€™t stick it. When youâ€™ve lived all the years I â€™ave in peace and quietness you canâ€™t get used to all that racket goinâ€™ on all the time.â€™ A few doors away was the Vauxhall Bridge Road and down it trams were clanging, ringing their bells as they went, motor buses were lumbering along, taxis were tooting their horns. If Mrs Hudson heard it, it was London she heard, and it soothed her as a motherâ€™s crooning soothes a restless child.
William Ashenden: "The Americans, who are the most efficient people on the earth, have carried this device [the use of "ready-made phrases"] to such a height of perfection and have invented so wide a range of pithy and hackneyed phrases that they can carry on an amusing and animated conversation without giving a moment's reflection to what they are saying and so leave their minds free to consider the more important matters of big business and fornication." (p. 25)
