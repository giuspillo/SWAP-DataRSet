Plot
'In order for Skala to live in peace and prosperity, a Queen must sit on the throne. Two children, one Queen, she will be marked by the blood of passage.'
A Dark tale entwining an entire kingdom in the fate of a young girl. Dark Magic, Hidden Destiny. For three centuries a divine prophecy and a line of warrior queens protected Skala. But the people grew complacent and Eruis, a usurper king, claimed his young half-sister's throne. Now plague and drought stalk the land, war with Skala's ancient rival Plenimar drains the country's lifeblood, and to be born female into the royal line has become a death sentence as the king fights to ensure the succession of his only heir, a son. For King Erius the greatest threat comes from his own line - and from Illior's faithful, who spread the Oracle's words to a doubting populace. As noblewomen young and old perish mysteriously the kings nephew - his sister's only child - grows toward manhood. But unbeknownst to the king or the boy, strange, haunted Tobin is the princess's daughter, given male form by dark magic to protect her until she can claim her rightful destiny. Only Tobin's noble father, two wizards of Illior and an outlawed forest witch know the truth. Only they can protect young Tobin from a king's wrath, a mother's madness, and the terrifying rage of her brother's demon spirit, determined to avenge his stolen life.
Reception
The book was generally acclaimed by readers and other authors.
â€œThe Bone Dollâ€™s Twin is a thoroughly engrossing new fantasy. It got its hooks into me on the first page, and didnâ€™t let loose until the last. I am already looking forward to the next installment.â€� â€” George R. R. Martin [1]
â€œA relentless tale that examines whether the ends can ever completely justify the means.â€� â€” Robin Hobb [1]
â€œFlewellingâ€™s language never calls attention to itself, and instead she brings us inside the heads of an array of splendid, believable characters. Which is what fiction is supposed to doâ€”give us fascinating people and powerful relationships from the inside out. Flewelling is a master of it. I fell in love with all her characters and hated for the book to end. Fortunately, it has a sequel ( Hidden Warrior ) [...]â€� â€” Orson Scott Card [2]
