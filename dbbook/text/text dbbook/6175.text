Plot summary
In an alternate world , where the existence of God has been scientifically proven and magic has been harnessed for the practical needs of the adept by the degaussing of cold iron , the United States is part of an alternative Second World War in which the enemy is not Germany but a resurgent Islamic Caliphate , which has invaded the United States. Werewolf Steven Matuchek and witch Virginia Graylock meet on a military mission to stop the invading Islamic army from unleashing a secret superweapon, a genie released from a bottle in which it had been sealed by King Solomon . Together, they fight against the demon and incidentally fall in love with each other.
After the end of the war (an Allied victory as in our World War II, but US forces remain in occupation of former enemy lands for much longer) the two of them continue and deepen their liaison and have various additional adventures (which were originally published as a series of independent stories). Among other things they stop an elemental summoned as a student prank which had gone amok, confront a succubus/incubus on their honeymoon, and enter the Hell dimension to save their daughter (who has been kidnapped and taken there, with a changeling left in her crib in her place).
