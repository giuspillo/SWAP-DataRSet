Book of Haikus is a collection of haiku poetry by Jack Kerouac. It was first published in 2003 and edited by Regina Weinreich. It consists of some 500 poems selected from a corpus of nearly 1,000 haiku jotted down by Kerouac in small notebooks. Although most of the poetry in Book of Haikus is original, some haiku are paraphrased in Kerouac's prose works: The top of Jack Mountain—done in By golden clouds also recurs in The Dharma Bums. The collection also contains a handful of haiku published earlier, for instance in Scattered Poems.
