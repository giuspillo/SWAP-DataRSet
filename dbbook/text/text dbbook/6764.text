The story takes place in Leningrad, USSR, apparently in the 1970s.
The protagonist, Dmitry Alekseyevich Malyanov (Ð”Ð¼Ð¸Ñ‚Ñ€Ð¸Ð¹ Ð�Ð»ÐµÐºÑ�ÐµÐµÐ²Ð¸Ñ‡ ÐœÐ°Ð»Ñ�Ð½Ð¾Ð²) is an astrophysicist who, while officially on vacation, continues to work on his thesis, "The Interaction of Stars with Diffused Galactic Matter". Just as he begins to realize that he is on the verge of a revolutionary discovery worthy of a Nobel Prize, his life becomes plagued by strange events.
First, Malyanov is visited unexpectedly by an attractive woman claiming to be his wife's classmate and food and wine arrive for them mysteriously and already paid for. Then his neighbor dies of an apparent suicide and Malyanov becomes the murder suspect.
Approaching the problem with a scientific mindset, Malyanov suspects that his discovery is in the way of someone (or something) intent on preventing the completion of his work. The same idea occurs to his friends and acquaintances, who find themselves in a similar impasse â€” some powerful, mysterious, and very selective force impedes their work in fields ranging from biology to mathematical linguistics.
An explanation is proposed by Malyanov's friend and neighbor, the mathematician Vecherovsky (Ð’ÐµÑ‡ÐµÑ€Ð¾Ð²Ñ�ÐºÐ¸Ð¹). He posits that the mysterious force is the Universe's reaction to the mankind's scientific pursuit, which threatens to destroy the very fabric of the universe in some distant future. Vecherovsky proposes to treat this universal resistance to scientific progress as a natural phenomenon which can and should be investigated and even harnessed by Science.
As the novel concludes, the other scientists, including Malyanov, have been forced to abandon their research, and Vecherovsky remains alone to battle the universe and continue their work.
