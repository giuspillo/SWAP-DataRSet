Reception
Simon Beckett writing in The Guardian is very positive: "The bottom line to this collection of short stories by British writer Dan Rhodes is that love hurts. Not news in itself, perhaps, but Rhodes's stories blow through the cobwebs of a much-handled subject like fresh air... The simplicity of Rhodes's style might be reminiscent of folklore and fairy tales, but that doesn't stop him getting to the heart of the matter." [2]
Michael Dirda in The Washington Post strikes a note of warning, "In form, Rhodes's stories resemble magical-realist fables or grim fairy tales. The style is seemingly artless, deliberately flat, sometimes even clichÃ©d. There's a kind of deadness at the heart of his sentences, as though all the emotion had been beaten out of them. If a zombie could write, it would sound about as lively as Dan Rhodes." but goes on to say "there's no denying the visceral power of his contes cruels. They stick in your mind, and the more you think about them the richer and more disheartening they become." He concludes "Don't Tell Me the Truth About Love is a powerful and impressive collection but very, very bleak. It's probably not the book to give your sweetie on February 14. You'd do better to stick with candy and flowers." [3]
Gregory Cowles on The New York Times was unimpressed though, "clever as these fables are, they're also dismayingly facile: Rhodes debunks pieties but doesn't replace them with actual insights. Only the long final story offers provocative ideas about the true nature of love. The 34-year-old Rhodes plainly has talent to burn, but in these stories he generates more smoke than fire. Considering his ample gifts, it's a shame to discover he's taken the book's title to heart." [4]
