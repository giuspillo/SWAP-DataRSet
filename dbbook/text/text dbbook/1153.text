Changes in new editions
Changes have been made to The Island of Adventure in newer editions of the books. These include:
The title of the US edition of the book was changed to Mystery Island.
The villain, Joe, was a black man named Jo-Jo in the original novel. References to his ethnicity have been removed.
The impossible geology of the story - essentially dry tunnels beneath the waterline - has been criticised in the New Scientist , but has remained uncorrected, as to do so would mangle the plot.
