Summary
From the front inside flap of The Forever King:
In a darkened house not far from the place where Camelot may once have stood, a madman schemes.
Once the cup that men call the Holy Grail was his. Soon it will be his again. The Grailâ€™s protectors are few and weak: an alcohol-soaked ex-FBI agent; a courtly old gentleman who once, long ago, held awesome power; and a ten year old boy.
Arthur Blessing is no ordinary boy. The Grail is his by chance, this time, but the power to keep it-is his by right.
Now he must stay alive long enough to use that power.
Arthur needs a defender, a man of great strength, skill, purity, and faith. Fate has given him Hal Woczniak, a broken-down drifter plagued by nightmare memories of a dead child. When Hal quit the FBI, he practically quit the human race as well.
Now, at the darkest time in his life, he is offered the chance to redeem himself.
One he failed to save a child. Once he failed to save a world.
He will not fail again.
