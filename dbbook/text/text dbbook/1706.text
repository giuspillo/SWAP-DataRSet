The Weapon Makers is a science fiction novel by A. E. van Vogt. The novel was originally serialized in Astounding Science Fiction in February–April 1943. In book form (1,000 copies), this serial was first published in 1947. It was then thoroughly revised in 1952, all subsequent printings contain the 1952 text. The events in the novel take place approximately seven years after the events described in The Weapon Shops of Isher (1951) even though the serial was published before some of the other Isher stories in The Weapon Shops of Isher. The first paperback edition, part of an Ace Double, was retitled One Against Eternity.
Reception
Groff Conklin described the 1952 edition as "a fascinating book . . . despite its bombast and its blithe impossibilities." [1] Boucher and McComas described the novel as "a grand fantasy-melodrama," although they questioned "whether its noble imaginative adventure has anything to do with science fiction.". [2] P. Schuyler Miller reviewed the novel favorably, describing it as "less pretentious and possibly less profound than the " Null-A " books." [3]
