Important storyline characters in the anime
Selba
Greedo's past Saga, who was killed by Greedo's archrival Killbeat, a bicorn.
Tornado Elemental Legion (Blue)
Fusion of Shiron, Zuou, and Garion
Volcano Elemental Legion (Red)
Fusion of Greedo, Wolfie, and Leon
Spiritual Elemental Legion (Gold)
Fusion of Shiron, Garion, and Greedo
CEO of DWC
As his name implies, he is the one who pulls all the strings at DWC (he wields more authority than Ranshiin). His entrance into the series is late, but his role is one of the most important.
Tornado King Dragon
One of the four Dragon Kings. Governs all wind-type Legendz
Storm King Dragon
One of the four Dragon Kings. Governs all water-type Legendz
Volcano King Dragon
One of the four Dragon Kings. Governs all fire-type Legendz
Earthquake King Dragon
One of the four Dragon Kings. Governs all earth-type Legendz
Jabberwock
A terrifying gigantic Legendz who is rightfully feared by those who have heard of him. He wields the power to manipulate both humans and Legendz.
The Legendz gods
Mysterious divine Legendz that appear near the end of the series, their only interest is in speaking to Shiron. The leader of these gods (a being cloaked in bright light so you can't make out his face) tends to go off subject and the others interrupt him before he goes off on a tangent, or interrupt him if he tries to explain a relevant subject that they know will likely not be understood by the one he's speaking to. An example of this is when he tried to explain the purpose of the Legendz War to Shiron, the others interrupted and explained they've tried telling that to multiple other Legendz before, but the point always flew over their heads.
Wind-Maker?/Kanerudo Windragon
An incredibly powerful Legendz of "legend" who had the power to wield all the elements. He was once the general of the army of Legendz and the heir to the throne of Tornado King Dragon. He nearly brought the world to ruin long ago and has not been heard from since, becoming no more than a legend. He is depicted in the removed and hidden final pages of the "Book of Legendz", along with many pages worth of undeciphered text. He is later reavealed to be Shiron himself when he and Ranshiin combine as one.
Characters in the manga
Ken Kazaki (é¢¨æ�¥ã‚±ãƒ³ , Kazaki Ken ? )
A normally aloof kid who takes Legendz seriously. His Legendz is the Windragon Shiron (ã‚·ãƒ­ãƒ³ ? ). He is the Wind Saga. He's really been influenced by Eiji Yashiro, after he had been beaten twice by him and ruthlessly pressed Shiron into training. Ken has a way of forcing others to drink his green tonic (that his grandmother made) for him; once his grandmother accidentally stuffed it down Yuki's throat, and he had pushed Shiron into doing so.
Ririko Yasuhara (å®‰åŽŸã‚Šã‚Šå­� , Yasuhara Ririko ? )
A girl talented at Legendz who has a Mermaid Tetty. She is the Saga of Water. The Water Saga's greatest gift is one of healing, which she used to the maximum when driven to do so. She likes Ken, and was shocked when learned that he was going to America.
Eiji Yashiro (å…«ä»£è‹±æ²» , Yashiro Eiji ? )
The champion of the previous year's Legendz Carnival. His Legendz is a Dwarf named Kotaro. When Ken was in third grade, Eiji taught him to respect his Legendz because they are alive. He moved to America shortly after that. He liked to flick Ken's forehead and grin, "I sure like your forehead."
Hideaki Hiyama (æªœå±±ãƒ’ãƒ‡ã‚¢ã‚­, Hiyama Hideaki ? )
A boy who loses to Ririko every time despite all of his research on the game.
When Ririko makes it to the finals of a school Legendz tournament, he takes out a case filled with many talispods, showing that he may raise numerous Legends at one time.

The school bully who thinks that he is the best at Legendz. Hosuke has a Troll named Banriki. He wants the Golden Soul Figure. He even tried cheating in the school Legendz tournament to acquire it. He was in the Ryudo Elementary Four, but it is unknown if he was kicked out. Ken calls him "troll."
Shunsuke Dekai (å‡ºæµ·çž¬è¼”, Dekai Shunsuke ? )
Hosuke's younger brother, who wants to win at Legendz. However, his neglection of his Werewolf Balthus prevents his victory. When Balthus is driven to attack him and Hosuke, Shunsuke refuses to attack back and instead defends himself and Hosuke, remarking that "Balthus is my best friend." Yet, later on, he loses to Tetty and Ririko.
Leo Engokuin (ç‚Žç�„é™¢ãƒ¬ã‚ª , Engokuin Reo ? )
The son of the president of DWC. He runs this year's Legendz Carnival competition. His Legendz is the Blazedragon Greedo. Leo is one of the two Fire Sagas. He had red eyes and fire came out of his hands, and had no friends as a child but his sister.
Kaoruko Goshika (å¾¡é¹¿ã‚«ã‚ªãƒ«ã‚³, Goshika Kaoruko ? )
A contestant in the Legendz Carnival. She is the daughter of a Legendz researcher looking for crystals (her character background is very similar to Haruka's in the anime). Her Legendz is Bjork the Golem. She is the Earth Saga. Ken calls her "Miss Underwear," because in the Legendz Carnival, she wore bloomers that Ken thought at first were underwear.
Namio Afuro (é˜¿é¢¨å‘‚ãƒŠãƒŸã‚ª, Afuro Namio ? ) / Namio Curly
Leo's assistant. His most prominent feature is his large Afro-style wig. He loves wigs, and tries them on when alone. He's even shown trying on a camo-styled wig. He's been with Leo a while.
Mio Engokuin (ç‚Žç�„é™¢ãƒŸã‚ª, Engokuin Mio ? )
Leo's older twin sister. Mio was kidnapped by Necrom, the Dark Kingdom. Mio is the other Fire Saga. She occasionally pulls on Leo's face, and once made him promise that he would be strong.

Meiko is a sixth grader at Kokuryu Elementary School and is Hosuke's self-proclaimed girlfriend. Meiko kidnaps Ririko to lure Ken to the school. Then she battles Ken with her Assassin Bug, Baiks (and loses, too).
Yuki Amagi (å¤©åŸŽå‹‡æ¨¹, Amagi YÅ«ki ? )
A sixth grader at Ken's school. Yuki offers Ken his Golden Soul Figure if Ken proves himself as worthy of the soul figure. Ken's reply? He stuffed it into Yuki's mouth. He is the leader of the Ryudo Four and wields the Yeti Gosetsu.
