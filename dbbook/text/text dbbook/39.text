Crime and Punishment (Russian: Преступлéние и наказáние Prestupleniye i nakazaniye) is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky. It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866. It was later published in a single volume. This is the second of Dostoyevsky's full-length novels following his return from ten years of exile in Siberia. Crime and Punishment is the first great novel of his "mature" period of writing. Crime and Punishment focuses on the mental anguish and moral dilemmas of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in St. Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a worthless vermin. He also commits this murder to test his own hypothesis that some people are naturally capable of such things, and even have the right to do them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov justifies his actions by connecting himself mentally with Napoleon Bonaparte, believing that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.
Creation
Dostoyevsky conceived the idea of Crime and Punishment in the summer of 1865, having gambled away much of his fortune, unable to pay his bills or afford proper meals. At the time the author owed large sums of money to creditors, and was trying to help the family of his brother Mikhail, who had died in early 1864. Projected under the title The Drunkards, it was to deal "with the present question of drunkness ... [in] all its ramifications, especially the picture of a family and the bringing up of children in these circumstance, etc., etc." Once Dostoyevsky conceived Raskolnikov and his crime, now inspired by the case of Pierre FranÃ§ois Lacenaire , this theme became ancillary, centering on the story of the Marmeladov family. [3]
Dostoyevsky offered his story or novella (at the time Dostoyevsky was not thinking of a novel [4] ) to the publisher Mikhail Katkov , whose monthly journal, The Russian Messenger , was a prestigious publication of its kind, and the outlet for both Ivan Turgenev and Leo Tolstoy . However, Dostoyevsky, having carried on quite bruising polemics with Katkov in early 1860s, had never published anything in its pages. Nonetheless, forced by his situation, after all other appeals elsewhere failed, Dostoyevsky turned as a last resort to Katkov, urging for an advance on a proposed contribution. [5] In a letter to Katkov written in September 1865, Dostoyevsky explained to him that the work was to be about a young man who yields to "certain strange, 'unfinished' ideas, yet floating in the air"; [6] he had thus embarked on his plan to explore the moral and psychological dangers of the ideology of "radicalism". [7] In letters written in November 1865 an important conceptual change occurred: the "story" has become a "novel", and from here on all references to Crime and Punishment are to a novel. [8]
Dostoyevsky had to race against time, in order to finish on time both The Gambler and Crime and Punishment. Anna Snitkina, a stenographer who would soon become his second wife, was a great help for Dostoyevsky during this difficult task. [9] The first part of Crime and Punishment appeared in the January 1866 issue of The Russian Messenger, and the last one was published in December 1866. [10]
At the end of November much had been written and was ready; I burned it all; I can confess that now. I didn't like it myself. A new form, a new plan excited me, and I started all over again.
â€” Dostoyevsky's letter to his friend Alexander Wrangel in February 1866 [11]
In the complete edition of Dostoyevsky's writings published in the Soviet Union , the editors reassembled and printed the notebooks that the writer kept while working on Crime and Punishment, in a sequence roughly corresponding to the various stages of composition. Because of these labors, there is now a fragmentary working draft of the story, or novella, as initially conceived, as well as two other versions of the text. These have been distinguished as the Wiesbaden edition, the Petersburg edition, and the final plan, involving the shift from a first-person narrator to the indigenous variety of third-person form invented by Dostoyevsky. [12] The Wiesbaden edition concentrates entirely on the moral/physic reactions of the narrator after the murder. It coincides roughly with the story that Dostoyevsky described in his letter to Katkov, and written in a form of a diary or journal, corresponds to what eventually became part II. [13]
I wrote [this chapter] with genuine inspiration, but perhaps it is no good; but for them the question is not its literary worth, they are worried about its morality. Here I was in the rightâ€”nothing was against morality, and even quite the contrary, but they saw otherwise and, what's more, saw traces of nihilism ... I took it back, and this revision of a large chapter cost me at least three new chapters of work, judging by the effort and the weariness; but I corrected it and gave it back.
â€” Dostoyevsky's letter to A.P. Milyukov [14]
Why Dostoyevsky abandoned his initial version remains a matter of speculation. According to Joseph Frank, "one possibility is that his protagonist began to develop beyond the boundaries in which he had first been conceived". [15] The notebooks indicate that Dostoyevsky was aware of the emergence of new aspects of Raskolnikov's character as the plot action proceeded, and he structured the novel in conformity with this "metamorphosis," Frank says. [16] Dostoyevsky thus decided to fuse the story with his previous idea for a novel called The Drunkards. [17] The final version of Crime and Punishment came to birth only when, in November 1865, Dostoyevsky decided to recast his novel in the third person. This shift was the culmination of a long struggle, present through all the early stages of composition. [18] Once having decided, Dostoyevsky began to rewrite from scratch, and was able to easily integrate sections of the early manuscript into the final textâ€”Frank says that he did not, as he told Wrangel, burn everything he had written earlier. [19]
The final draft went smoothly, except for a clash with the editors of The Russian Messenger, about which very little is known. Since the manuscript Dostoyevsky turned in to Katkov was lost, it is unclear to what the editors had objected in the original.
Plot
Raskolnikov, a conflicted former student, lives in a tiny, rented room in Saint Petersburg . He refuses all help, even from his friend Razumikhin, and devises a plan to murder and to rob an unpleasant elderly pawn-broker and money-lender, Alyona Ivanovna. His motivation comes from the overwhelming sense that he is predetermined to kill the old woman by some power outside of himself. While still considering the plan, Raskolnikov makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who recently squandered his family's little wealth. He also receives a letter from his sister and mother, speaking of their coming visit to Saint Petersburg, and his sister's sudden marriage plans which they plan to discuss upon their arrival.
After much deliberation, Raskolnikov sneaks into Alyona Ivanovna's apartment, where he murders her with an axe. He also kills her half-sister, Lizaveta, who happens to stumble upon the scene of the crime. Shaken by his actions, Raskolnikov manages to steal only a handful of items and a small purse, leaving much of the pawn-broker's wealth untouched. Raskolnikov then flees and, due to a series of coincidences, manages to leave unseen and undetected.
After the bungled murder, Raskolnikov falls into a feverish state and begins to worry obsessively over the murder. He hides the stolen items and purse under a rock, and tries desperately to clean his clothing of any blood or evidence. He falls into a fever later that day, though not before calling briefly on his old friend Razumikhin. As the fever comes and goes in the following days, Raskolnikov behaves as though he wishes to betray himself. He shows strange reactions to whoever mentions the murder of the pawn-broker, which is now known about and talked of in the city. In his delirium, Raskolnikov wanders Saint Petersburg, drawing more and more attention to himself and his relation to the crime. In one of his walks through the city, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage in the streets. Rushing to help him, Raskolnikov gives the remainder of his money to the man's family, which includes his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has been forced to become a prostitute to support her family.
In the meantime, Raskolnikov's mother, Pulkheria Alexandrovna, and his sister, Avdotya Romanovna (or Dounia) have arrived in the city. Avdotya had been working as a governess for the SvidrigaÃ¯lov family until this point, but was forced out of the position by the head of the family, Arkady Ivanovich SvidrigaÃ¯lov. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, a married man, was attracted to Avdotya's physical beauty and her feminine qualities, and offered her riches and elopement. Avdotya, having none of this, fled the family and lost her source of income, only to meet Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, a man of modest income and rank. Luzhin proposes to marry Avdotya, thereby securing her and her mother's financial safety, provided she accept him quickly and without question. It is for these very reasons that the two of them come to Saint Petersburg, both to meet Luzhin there and to obtain Raskolnikov's approval. Luzhin, however, calls on Raskolnikov while he is in a delirious state and presents himself as a foolish, self-righteous and presuming man. Raskolnikov dismisses him immediately as a potential husband for his sister, and realizes that she only accepted him to help her family.
As the novel progresses, Raskolnikov is introduced to the detective Porfiry, who begins to suspect him for the murder purely on psychological grounds. At the same time, a chaste relationship develops between Raskolnikov and Sonya. Sonya, though a prostitute, is full of Christian virtue and is only driven into the profession by her family's poverty. Meanwhile, Razumikhin and Raskolnikov manage to keep Avdotya from continuing her relationship with Luzhin, whose true character is exposed to be conniving and base. At this point, SvidrigaÃ¯lov appears on the scene, having come from the province to Petersburg, almost solely to seek out Avdotya. He reveals that his wife is dead, and that he is willing to pay Avdotya a vast sum of money in exchange for nothing. She, upon hearing the news, refuses flat out, suspecting him of treachery.
As Raskolnikov and Porfiry continue to meet, Raskolnikov's motives for the crime become exposed. Porfiry becomes increasingly certain of the man's guilt, but has no concrete evidence or witnesses with which to back up this suspicion. Furthermore, another man admits to committing the crime under questioning and arrest. However, Raskolnikov's nerves continue to wear thin, and he is constantly struggling with the idea of confessing, though he knows that he can never be truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her. By coincidence, SvidrigaÃ¯lov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, SvidrigaÃ¯lov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should he need to. SvidrigaÃ¯lov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dounia, SvidrigaÃ¯lov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.
Raskolnikov is at this point completely torn; he is urged by Sonya to confess, and SvidrigaÃ¯lov's testimony could potentially convict him. Furthermore, Porfiry confronts Raskolnikov with his suspicions and assures him confession would substantially lighten his sentence. Meantime, SvidrigaÃ¯lov attempts to seduce Avdotya, but when he realizes that she will never love him, he lets her go. He then spends a night in confusion and in the morning shoots himself. This same morning, Raskolnikov goes again to Sonya, who again urges him to confess and to clear his conscience. He makes his way to the police station, where he is met by the news of SvidrigaÃ¯lov's suicide. He hesitates a moment, thinking again that he might get away with a perfect crime, but is persuaded by Sonya to confess.
The epilogue tells of how Raskolnikov is sentenced to eight years of penal servitude in Siberia , where Sonya follows him. Avdotya and Razumikhin marry and are left in a happy position by the end of the novel, while Pulkheria, Raskolnikov's mother, falls ill and dies, unable to cope with her son's situation. Raskolnikov himself struggles in Siberia. It is only after some time in prison that his redemption and moral regeneration begin under Sonya's loving influence. [20]
Characters
In Crime and Punishment, Dostoyevsky succeeds in fusing the personality of his main character, Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov (Russian: Ð Ð¾Ð´Ð¸Ð¾Ð½ Ð Ð¾Ð¼Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ‡ Ð Ð°Ñ�ÐºÐ¾Ð»ÑŒÐ½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð²), with his new anti-radical ideological themes. The main plot involves a murder as the result of "ideological intoxication," and depicts all the disastrous moral and psychical consequences that result from the murder. Raskolnikov's psychology is placed at the center, and carefully interwoven with the ideas behind his transgression; every other feature of the novel illuminates the agonizing dilemma in which Raskolnikov is caught. [21] From another point of view, the novel's plot is another variation of a conventional nineteenth-century theme: an innocent young provincial comes to seek his fortune in the capital, where he succumbs to corruption, and loses all traces of his former freshness and purity. However, as Gary Rosenshield points out, "Raskolnikov succumbs not to the temptations of high society as HonorÃ© de Balzac 's Rastignac or Stendhal 's Julien Sorel , but to those of rationalistic Petersburg". [22]
Raskolnikov (Rodion) is the protagonist , and the novel focuses primarily on his perspective. A 23-year-old man and former student, now destitute, Raskolnikov is described in the novel as "exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim, well built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair." Perhaps the most striking feature of Raskolnikov, however, is his dual personality. On the one hand, he is cold, apathetic, and antisocial; on the other, he can be surprisingly warm and compassionate. He commits murder as well as acts of compulsive charity. His chaotic interaction with the external world and his nihlistic worldview might be seen as a the cause of his social alienation or the consequence of it.
Despite its name, the novel does not so much deal with the crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's internal struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing society would be better for it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, [based on his paper/thesis, "On Crime", that he is a Napoleon ], but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.
Sofia Semyonovna Marmeladova (Russian: Ð¡Ð¾Ñ„ÑŒÑ� Ð¡ÐµÐ¼Ñ‘Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð° ÐœÐ°Ñ€Ð¼ÐµÐ»Ð°Ð´Ð¾Ð²Ð°), variously called Sonia (Sonya) and Sonechka, is the daughter of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern at the beginning of the novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and even innocent despite the fact that she is compelled into prostitution to help her family. She also, as Raskolnikov discerns, shares the same feelings of shame and alienation as he does and becomes the first person to whom Raskolnikov confesses his crime, and she supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov, and in some interpretations, even considered a Christ-like figure. She is forced to prostitute herself to provide for her family, leading some critics to make comparisons with Mary Magdalene.
Avdotya Romanovna Raskolnikova (Ð�Ð²Ð´Ð¾Ñ‚ÑŒÑ� Ð Ð¾Ð¼Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð° Ð Ð°Ñ�ÐºÐ¾Ð»ÑŒÐ½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð²Ð°) â€“ Raskolnikov's dominant and sympathetic sister, called Dunya, Dounia or Dunechka for short. She initially plans to marry the wealthy, yet smug and self-possessed, Luzhin, to free the family from financial destitution. She has a habit of pacing across the room while thinking. She is followed to Saint Petersburg by the disturbed Svidrigailov, who seeks to win her back through blackmail. She rejects both men in favour of Raskolnikov's loyal friend, Razumikhin.
Pulkheria Alexandrovna Raskolnikova (ÐŸÑƒÐ»ÑŒÑ…ÐµÑ€Ð¸Ñ� Ð�Ð»ÐµÐºÑ�Ð°Ð½Ð´Ñ€Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð° Ð Ð°Ñ�ÐºÐ¾Ð»ÑŒÐ½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð²Ð°) â€“ Raskolnikov's relatively clueless, hopeful and loving mother. Following Raskolnikov's sentence, she falls ill (mentally and physically) and eventually dies. She hints in her dying stages that she is slightly more aware of her son's fate, which was hidden from her by Dunya and Razumikhin.
Dmitri Prokofich Razumikhin (Ð”Ð¼Ð¸Ñ‚Ñ€Ð¸Ð¹ ÐŸÑ€Ð¾ÐºÐ¾Ñ„ÑŒÐ¸Ñ‡ Ð Ð°Ð·ÑƒÐ¼Ð¸Ñ…Ð¸Ð½) â€“ Raskolnikov's loyal friend. In terms of Razumikhin's contribution to Dostoyevsky's anti-radical thematics, he is intended to represent something of a reconciliation of the pervasive thematic conflict between faith and reason. The fact that his name means "reason" shows Dostoyevsky's desire to employ this faculty as a foundational basis for his Christian faith in God.
Other characters of the novel are:
Praskovya Pavlovna Zarnitsyna (ÐŸÑ€Ð°Ñ�ÐºÐ¾Ð²ÑŒÑ� ÐŸÐ°Ð²Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð° Ð—Ð°Ñ€Ð½Ð¸Ñ†Ñ‹Ð½Ð°) â€“ Raskolnikov's landlady (called Pashenka). Shy and retiring, Praskovya Pavlovna does not figure prominently in the course of events. Raskolnikov had been engaged to her daughter, a sickly girl who had died, and Praskovya Pavlovna had granted him extensive credit on the basis of this engagement and a promissory note for 115 roubles. She had then handed this note to a court councillor named Chebarov, who had claimed the note, causing Raskolnikov to be summoned to the police station the day after his crime.
Porfiry Petrovich(ÐŸÐ¾Ñ€Ñ„Ð¸Ñ€Ð¸Ð¹ ÐŸÐµÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ‡) â€“ The detective in charge of solving the murders of Lizaveta and Alyona Ivanovna, who, along with Sonya, moves Raskolnikov towards confession. Unlike Sonya, however, Porfiry does this through psychological games. Despite the lack of evidence, he becomes certain Raskolnikov is the murderer following several conversations with him, but gives him the chance to confess voluntarily. He attempts to confuse and to provoke the unstable Raskolnikov in an attempt to coerce him to confess.
Arkady Ivanovich SvidrigaÃ¯lov (Ð�Ñ€ÐºÐ°Ð´Ð¸Ð¹ Ð˜Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ‡ Ð¡Ð²Ð¸Ð´Ñ€Ð¸Ð³Ð°Ð¹Ð»Ð¾Ð²) â€“ Sensual, depraved, and wealthy former employer and current pursuer of Dunya, SvidrigaÃ¯lov is suspected of multiple acts of murder, and overhears Raskolnikov's confessions to Sonya. With this knowledge he torments both Dunya and Raskolnikov but does not inform the police. When Dunya tells him she could never love him (after attempting to shoot him) he lets her go and commits suicide . Despite his apparent malevolence, SvidrigaÃ¯lov is similar to Raskolnikov in regard to his random acts of charity. He fronts the money for the Marmeladov children to enter an orphanage (after both their parents die), gives Sonya five percent bank notes totalling three thousand rubles, and leaves the rest of his money to his juvenile fiancÃ©e . There is an interesting fact: SvidrigaÃ¯lov has blue eyes; blue color in Russian culture symbolizes purity, kindness, and innocence, implying that SvidrigaÃ¯lov is a good person beneath his philandering exterior. (It is noteworthy that Sonya also has blue eyes.)
Marfa Petrovna SvidrigaÃ¯lova (ÐœÐ°Ñ€Ñ„Ð° ÐŸÐµÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð° Ð¡Ð²Ð¸Ð´Ñ€Ð¸Ð³Ð°Ð¹Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð°) â€“ Arkady SvidrigaÃ¯lov's deceased wife, whom he is suspected of having murdered, and who he claims has visited him as a ghost. Her bequest of 3,000 rubles to Dunya allows Dunya to reject Luzhin as a suitor.
Katerina Ivanovna Marmeladova (ÐšÐ°Ñ‚ÐµÑ€Ð¸Ð½Ð° Ð˜Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð° ÐœÐ°Ñ€Ð¼ÐµÐ»Ð°Ð´Ð¾Ð²Ð°) â€“ Semyon Marmeladov's consumptive and ill-tempered second wife, stepmother to Sonya. She drives Sonya into prostitution in a fit of rage, but later regrets it, and beats her children mercilessly, but works ferociously to improve their standard of living. She is obsessed with demonstrating that slum life is far below her station. Following Marmeladov's death, she uses Raskolnikov's money to hold a funeral. She later succumbs to her illness. The character is partially based on Polina Suslova . [23]
Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov (Ð¡ÐµÐ¼Ñ‘Ð½ Ð—Ð°Ñ…Ð°Ñ€Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ‡ ÐœÐ°Ñ€Ð¼ÐµÐ»Ð°Ð´Ð¾Ð²) â€“ Hopeless drunk who indulges in his own suffering, and father of Sonya. Marmeladov could be seen as a Russian equivalent of the character of Micawber in Charles Dickens ' novel, David Copperfield .
Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin (ÐŸÑ‘Ñ‚Ñ€ ÐŸÐµÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ‡ Ð›ÑƒÐ¶Ð¸Ð½) â€“ A well-off lawyer who is engaged to Raskolnikov's sister Dunya in the beginning of the novel. His motives for the marriage are rather despicable, as he states more or less that he chose her since she will be completely beholden to him financially.
Andrey Semyenovich Lebezyatnikov (Ð�Ð½Ð´Ñ€ÐµÐ¹ Ð¡ÐµÐ¼Ñ‘Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ‡ Ð›ÐµÐ±ÐµÐ·Ñ�Ñ‚Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð²) â€“ Luzhin's utopian socialist and feminist roommate who witnesses his attempt to frame Sonya and subsequently exposes him
Alyona Ivanovna (Ð�Ð»Ñ‘Ð½Ð° Ð˜Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð°) â€“ Suspicious old pawnbroker who hoards money and is merciless to her patrons. She is Raskolnikov's intended target, and he kills her in the beginning of the book.
Lizaveta Ivanovna (Ð›Ð¸Ð·Ð°Ð²ÐµÑ‚Ð° Ð˜Ð²Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð°) â€“ Alyona's handicapped, innocent and submissive sister. Raskolnikov murders her when she walks in immediately after Raskolnikov had killed Alyona. Lizaveta was a friend of Sonya.
Zosimov (Ð—Ð¾Ñ�Ð¸Ð¼Ð¾Ð²) â€“ A friend of Razumikhin and a doctor who cared for Raskolnikov
Nastasya Petrovna (Ð�Ð°Ñ�Ñ‚Ð°Ñ�ÑŒÑ� ÐŸÐµÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð°) â€“ Raskolnikov's landlady's servant who often brings Raskolnikov food and drink
Nikodim Fomich (Ð�Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð´Ð¸Ð¼ Ð¤Ð¾Ð¼Ð¸Ñ‡)â€“ The amiable chief of police
Ilya "Gunpowder" Petrovich (Ð˜Ð»ÑŒÑ� ÐŸÐµÑ‚Ñ€Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ‡) â€“ A police official and Fomich's assistant
Alexander Grigorievich Zamyotov (Ð�Ð»ÐµÐºÑ�Ð°Ð½Ð´Ñ€ Ð“Ñ€Ð¸Ð³Ð¾Ñ€ÑŒÐµÐ²Ð¸Ñ‡ Ð—Ð°Ð¼ÐµÑ‚Ð¾Ð²) â€“ Head clerk at the police station and friend to Razumikhin. Raskolnikov arouses Zamyotov's suspicions by explaining how he, Raskolnikov, would have committed various crimes, although Zamyotov later apologizes, believing, much to Raskolnikov's amusement, that it was all a farce to expose how ridiculous the suspicions were.
Nikolai Dementiev (Ð�Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð»Ð°Ð¹ Ð”ÐµÐ¼ÐµÐ½Ñ‚ÑŒÐµÐ²) â€“ A self-sacrificial painter and sectarian who admits to the murder, since his sect holds it to be supremely virtuous to suffer for another person's crime
Polina Mikhailovna Marmeladova (ÐŸÐ¾Ð»Ð¸Ð½Ð° ÐœÐ¸Ñ…Ð°Ð¹Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð½Ð° ÐœÐ°Ñ€Ð¼ÐµÐ»Ð°Ð´Ð¾Ð²Ð°) â€“ Ten-year-old adopted daughter of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov and younger stepsister to Sonya, sometimes known as Polechka
