â€œ
To Katie Roiphe, feminism had always meant freedom â€” but as an undergraduate at Harvard and a graduate at Princeton, she was shocked to discover that the same movement that had once promised women a voice was now being used to tell them what they ought to say and think and feel. This book arose out of her frustration with today's feminism and with the hypocrisy of a culture that idealizes freedom of speech but refuses to tolerate real dissent.
In The Morning After, Roiphe takes an uncomfortably close look at how that intolerance is manifest, offering penetrating critiques of our urge to legislate love and desire, our infatuation with consent, and our unreasonable fear of the human imagination, which is expected to stoop before rules about sex and gender. Ground-breaking and controversial, The Morning After inspired heated debate the world over. Now read it and make up your own mind.
