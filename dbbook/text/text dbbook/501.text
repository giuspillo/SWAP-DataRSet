Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized Society is a 1960 book by Paul Goodman. The book was rejected by nineteen publishers before being serialized in Commentary, and was eventually published with the assistance of Norman Podhoretz. Todd Dufresne compares Growing Up Absurd to both Herbert Marcuse's Eros and Civilization and Norman O. Brown's Life Against Death, noting that its influence can be measured in terms of sales figures: over one hundred thousand copies of Growing Up Absurd were sold in its first few years.
