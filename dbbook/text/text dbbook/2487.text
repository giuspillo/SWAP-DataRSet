Banquets of the Black Widowers is a collection of mystery short stories by science fiction author Isaac Asimov featuring his fictional club of mystery solvers, the Black Widowers. It was first published in hardcover by Doubleday in 1984, and in paperback by the Fawcett Crest imprint of Ballantine Books in June 1986. This book is the fourth of the six books featuring the Black Widowers. It collects twelve stories by Asimov, together with a general introduction and an afterword following each story by the author. Ten of the stories were previously published; the last two are new to this collection. Each story involves the club members' knowledge of trivia. Nearly every story here is about decoding a riddle, each of which provides a clue based on dying or last words, misunderstood words, forgotten words, or withheld words. A few are based on facts that are, perhaps, not generally known to the public – Asimov was a frequent writer of popular science and his inclination to explain anything and everything for the general public carried over into other fields, such as history and sociology – but those mysteries feel as though they play fair with the reader, who is given either enough information to figure out the solution or a satisfying conclusion that is based on previously given facts and personality qualities.

"Introduction"
" Sixty Million Trillion Combinations " (Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, 5 May 1980) â€“ A paranoid mathematician who suspects that his work on Goldbach's conjecture has been stolen. When the authorities demand his cooperation, he sulkily gives a clue to the code which protects his work on a shared computer, suspecting that no one could possibly guess or deduce the code. Fortunately for the agencies who need this information, the Black Widowers are able to come up with the code, purely because one member shares a trait with the mathematician.
"The Woman in the Bar" (Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, 30 June 1980) â€“ the Black Widowers have as their dinner guest Darius Just, the main character from Asimov's mystery novel Murder at the ABA .
