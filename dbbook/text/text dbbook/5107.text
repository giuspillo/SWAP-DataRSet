Trivia
One of the scenes in the novel is strongly reminiscent of a scene in The Sorrows of Young Werther . In Kerouacâ€™s novel, a blizzard rages outside during a party organized for the seventeenth birthday of Jack Duluoz. The party is the start of the estrangement of Jack and Maggie. The first time Werther meets his Lotte is during a ball in the country whilst a storm (foreshadowing Wertherâ€™s demise) is passing outside. [4] Kerouac is known to have read Goethe . [5]
The fictitious name of Kerouacâ€™s girlfriend echoes the name of Neal Cassady . Who, under the fictitious name of Dean Moriarty, would be the centre of Kerouacâ€™s attention in On the Road .

Together with books such as The Subterraneans and The Dharma Bums they make up the Duluoz legend which Kerouac compared to Proustâ€™s In Search of Lost Time . â€œ[...]except that my remembrances are written on the run instead of afterwards in a sick bed.â€� [6]
