Forward the Foundation (1993) is a novel written by Isaac Asimov. It is the second of two prequels to the Foundation Series. It is written in much the same style as the original novel Foundation, a novel composed of chapters with long intervals in between. (Both books were first published as independent short stories in science fiction magazines. ) The parallels between Hari Seldon and Isaac Asimov found in this book—the last one written by Asimov—and the focus on Hari Seldon as he grows old and dies, strengthen the idea that Asimov considered Seldon his literary alter ego. Many regard some of the thoughts and opinions expressed by Seldon in this book as autobiographical; a double reading of Forward the Foundation may shed light on Asimov's inner thoughts at the end of his life.

Plot summary
In Forward the Foundation, Isaac Asimov continues the chronicles of the life of Hari Seldon , first begun in Prelude to Foundation .
The story takes place on Trantor , and begins eight years after the events of Prelude to Foundation. It depicts how Seldon developed his theory of psychohistory from hypothetical concept to practical application in galactic events.
Beginning during the latter years of the reign of Emperor Cleon I , Seldon's work brings him into the world of galactic politics, and takes him to the height of Imperial power as Cleon's First Minister, after the mysterious disappearance of his previous First Minister, Eto Demerzel (whom Seldon knows as R. Daneel Olivaw ). Seldon becomes First Minister to the Emperor, but loses the position ten years later after the Emperor is assassinated.
Gradually, Seldon loses all those who are close to him. Seldon's wife Dors is killed saving his life from an assassin. His adopted son Raych is killed in the Rebellion in Santanni; his daughter-in-law and second granddaughter are missing and never found. Yugo Amaryl dies early, brought on by the strain of his work. Except for his granddaughter Wanda , Seldon is alone. He eventually sends her off to start the Second Foundation .
The Galactic Empire 's decline accelerates during the later chapters, as does the decline of Seldon's physical health. At the same time, Seldon finally begins to unravel the secrets of psychohistory ; he initiates a grand plan that will come to be known as the Seldon Plan , the road map for mankind's post-Imperial survival.
