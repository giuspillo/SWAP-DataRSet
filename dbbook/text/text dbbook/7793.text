The Beast Within is a horror novel written by Edward Levy.

Film, TV or theatrical adaptations
The Beast Within is a 1982 horror film loosely based on the novel. The film rights for the novel were quickly purchased, but when the film was released, the screen adaptation bore very little resemblance to the novel (such as the time setting was changed from the 1920s to the decade when the film was released).
