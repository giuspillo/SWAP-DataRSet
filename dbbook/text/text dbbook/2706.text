Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad is a 1999 book by Welsh author Gordon Thomas on the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service. In the book the author claimed that—eight months before Kenneth Starr had ever heard of Monica Lewinsky— the Israelis had about thirty hours of recorded tapes of President Bill Clinton talking intimately with her. It is also written that Jerusalem was keeping these tapes either for blackmail or to defend its mole in White House, whose code name was "Mega."
