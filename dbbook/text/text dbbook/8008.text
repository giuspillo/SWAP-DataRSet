Plot introduction
The action mostly takes place in Southern California , in 1987.
Frank Marrity (a widower) and his twelve-year-old daughter, Daphne, are drawn into a dangerously occult world when his grandmother (called affectionately "Grammar") dies in bizarre circumstances. Soon, Frank and Daphne are pursued by agents who know much more about their lives than they doâ€”for example, that Grammar is the daughter of Albert Einstein and that she was friends with Charlie Chaplin â€”and that all three of them had discovered secrets to time travel and had found how to change prior events, perhaps to please themselves.
Frank and Daphne, who wish to live their normal lives (he teaches English, she is his loving daughter, also fond of English literature), find their lives invaded by secret agents. The apparently sympathetic agents are of the Mossad , one member of which wishes only to travel back in time to change certain events during the Six-Day War , which left him crippled, whereas an opposing group wants to murder Frank Marrity for reasons he cannot understand.
