Beautiful Losers is a novel by Leonard Cohen. Published in 1966 by McClelland and Stewart, it was the Canadian writer's second novel, and precedes his career as a singer-songwriter. Set in Quebec, Canada, the story of the 17th century Mohawk saint Kateri Tekakwitha is interwoven with the story of a love triangle between an unnamed anglophone Canadian folklorist; his Native wife, Edith, who has committed suicide; and his best friend, the mystical F, a Member of Parliament and leader in the Quebec separatist movement, who dies after being imprisoned in an institute for the criminally insane. The complex novel makes use a vast range of literary techniques, and a wealth of allusion, imagery and symbolism. It is noted for its excesses of language, technique and sexuality. Very much a product of the 1960s, it is filled with the mysticism, radicalism, sexuality and drug-taking emblematic of the era. Cohen wrote the novel in two eight-month spurts while living on the Greek island of Hydra in 1964 and 1965. He fasted and consumed amphetamines to focus his creativity on the novel. Despite a lavish rollout, sales were disappointing, and critics were initially unsympathetic or hostile. The book gained critical and commercial attention only after Cohen had given up novel-writing and turned to songwriting and performing, upon which his fame rests today. It is now seen as having introduced postmodernism to Canadian literature. It has become a steady seller, and is considered a part of the Canadian literary canon.

The island of Hydra , where Cohen wrote Beautiful Losers
Cohen had published a number of books of poetry since the 1956 appearance of Let Us Compare Mythologies , and one novel, The Favourite Game (1963). [25] He had been living on the Greek island of Hydra in the early to mid-1960s, and had composed The Favourite Game and a book of poetry, Flowers for Hitler , there.[ citation needed ] On Hydra, English was spoken, and there was an artists' colony there. [26]
Cohen wanted to write a "liturgy, a big confessional oration, very crazy, but using all the techniques of the modern novel ... pornographic suspense, humor and conventional plotting". [27]
Cohen wrote most of the novel during two concentrated eight-month periods in 1964 and 1965. He wrote using a typewriter in a house in Hydra while listening to a portable record player , on which he listened to his favourite Ray Charles record, The Genius Sings the Blues . At first he managed only three pages a day, and sometimes wrote only one hour a day. When the novel began to take shape, he worked up to fifteen hours a day, with the help of amphetamines . [27] He later claimed that amphetamine use was a mistake "for depressed people", as coming down was particularly hard. He said it took "ten years to fully recover". [28]
The first period of writing was interrupted when Cohen returned to Canada in October 1964 to receive the Prix litteraire du QuÃ©bec for The Favourite Game, followed by a reading tour. One result of the tour was the film Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. Leonard Cohen , released in 1965 from the National Film Board of Canada . The tour embittered Cohen, though, as he complained about money and the lack of exposure for his first novel. [28] He found himself torn on the issue of Quebec separation that had arisen as the Quiet Revolution heated up. Montreal's francophone community was asserting itself against the anglophone elite. The Front de LibÃ©ration du QuÃ©bec had begun targeting anglophones with bombs in 1963, and a statue of Queen Victoria on Sherbrooke Street was destroyed with a bomb on 12 July. This political turmoil found its way into Cohen's work when he returned to Hydra. [29]
Cohen practised fasting during the composition of the novel, believing that it helped focus his creativity and spirituality. Following its completion, Cohen broke down, collapsing from sunstroke and amphetamine consumption. He had hallucinations, and had withered to 116 pounds after going without food for ten days. [30]
Cohen published another book of poetry, Parasites of Heaven , in 1966, [31] but by then it became clear to Cohen that he would be unable to make a living as a writer. He shifted focus to music, particularly after becoming interested in Bob Dylan in 1966. That year, he decided to devote himself seriously to a singing career. [32] It was his music for which he later became well known. [33]

In March 1965, Cohen told Jack McClelland , president of Canadian publishing house McClelland and Stewart , [a] that he would finish the novel in a month. He stated that it would be a success if it escaped the censors, and asked for a cash advance, as he was in need of money. When he completed it three weeks later, he declared that he had "written the Bhagavad Gita of 1965". He claimed he had figured out how to "write a novel in three weeks", and that he would manage four more in 1965. [35]
Cohen pondered a number of titles for the book. On two different drafts were the titles Beautiful Losers / A Pop Novel and Plastic Birchbark / A Treatment of the World, and notes and letters show him listing many other possible titles. [36] Viking put the difficult book through eight readings before deciding to publish it. [30] Cohen responded to the book's acceptance with a parodic six-page letter anticipating the response of offended Canadian critics. [37] As a condition of the book's publication, Cohen insisted on having control over the cover and jacket copy, so as to avoid the disappointment he had had with the publication of Flowers for Hitler. Further, he insisted on no quotations from critics on the jacket. [37]
Publication was somewhat complicated when Cohen lost a carbon copy of the original manuscript to the wind. He was able to continue with revisions after having his New York agent send him another carbon copy. The pre-publication orders of 3,100 copies were more than expected. Before publication, a number of film producers were eying the book, such as Otto Preminger , Ulu Grosbard , Alexander Cohen and the MCA Group . [38]
McClelland realized that censorship would be a problem in Canada, and tried to soften the blow with advance publicity via advance copies. The responses from the readers of the advance copies were too negative for him to use, however. A gala lunch was thrown a month in advance of the book's release, and about four hundred of the top names in the Canadian arts world appeared there. Posters had Cohen in a turtleneck and jacket in the hopes that such a sober pose would offset the anticipated scandal. The University of Toronto , which had started collecting Cohen's papers starting in 1964, paid Cohen $6,000 for the original manuscript. [39]
The first printing was printed by Viking and bound by McClelland & Stewart. It included typographical extras not included in future editions, such as comic book captions, a Charles Axis advertisement, a radio transcript of Gavin and the Goddesses , and a Greek-English phrase book. [33]
Distribution was restricted, with Simpson's and W. H. Smith refusing to carry the book, despite McClelland's reassurances to W. H. Smith that "most of the people interested in pornography would not begin to understand either Cohen's purpose or his accomplishment". The $6.50 cover price dampened sales as well. Cohen thought it too high, but McClelland explained it was necessary to offset the publication costs and extensive promotion. He accused Cohen of being "unwilling to put [him]self out" in the way of promotion, and urged him to do more television and radio interviews. [40]
