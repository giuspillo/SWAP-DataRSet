Grail Prince, a 2003 novel by Nancy McKenzie written in the tradition of Arthurian legends, recounts a version of Galahad's quest for the Holy Grail. The novel is a sequel to McKenzie's Queen of Camelot (2002).
Plot summary
Before his death, King Arthur sends young Galahad, the oldest son of Lancelot and Elaine, on a quest to find the lost treasures of an ancient king â€” a Grail, a Spear, a Sword â€” which will safeguard Britainâ€™s future.
For Galahad the search becomes a transforming journey into manhood. His quest challenges his famed gallantry and purity, the traits which set him apart in Arthurian legend as the only knight fit for and worthy of the quest for the Holy Grail.
Critical reception
Publishers Weekly s' review was positive, writing that "familiarity with the Arthurian legends isn't necessary to enjoy this engrossing medieval fantasy." [1] The Romantic Times stated that the novel was "a highly original interpretation of the character of Galahad. At times his overly sanctimonious attitude creates heartrending scenes, but Ms. McKenzie showcases the human frailties of love and honor as the boy becomes a man." [2]
