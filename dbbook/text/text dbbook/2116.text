The main character of Working!!, SÅ�ta is a 16-year-old high school student recruited by Popura to become a new employee at the family restaurant Wagnaria. He is enamored by cute things and thus favors Popura over the other employees due to her cute appearance. He voices his thoughts out loud and occasionally offends his co-workers, often resulting in him getting punished by them. He usually finds his co-workers and the rules of the restaurant to be strange, but he still has an attachment to his job. He is able to adapt quickly to his job at the restaurant. He has three older sisters and dislikes older women as he has been tormented by them all his life. He received hand-me-downs from his sisters when he was young, giving him the appearance of a little girl. He also has a younger sister in elementary school who is almost as tall as he is, but unlike his older sisters, respects him. Despite his problems, he is occasionally forced to cross-dress as a girl named Kotori (å°�é³¥ ? , derived from the first two kanji in his surname), which is derived from SÅ�ta's family name. Despite the fact that he constantly gets hit by Mahiru, he is actually quite skilled in fighting, as his sister taught him self-defense. He does not fight Mahiru because his sister taught him not to hit girls.
Popura Taneshima (ç¨®å³¶ ã�½ã�·ã‚‰, Taneshima Popura ? )
Voiced by: Kana Asumi , Mai Kadowaki (drama CD)
Popura is a short 17-year-old high school student who works at Wagnaria. Ironically, she was named after the poplar tree so that she would grow tall. She is a hard worker, but she sometimes makes clumsy mistakes in her job. She is very sensitive about her small appearance; many customers usually mistake her to be younger than she really is. She often fails to gain respect from SÅ�ta, who is one year younger than her, as he usually regards her as an elementary school student. She is also unable to properly call him by his surname, saying "Katanashi" rather than "Takanashi", even when corrected. She admires Kotori, SÅ�ta's cross-dressing persona, and the Takanashi sisters because of their tall and mature look.
Mahiru Inami (ä¼Šæ³¢ ã�¾ã�²ã‚‹, Inami Mahiru ? )
Voiced by: Saki Fujita , Mai Nakahara (drama CD)
Mahiru is a timid, 17-year-old girl who joins the rest of the employees at Wagnaria. She has androphobia and is thus terrified of men; she punches any male that comes near her. This violent behavior arises from childhood, when her father, who did not want his daughter to eventually marry, told her that every man is ready to attack her and conditioned her to violently attacking men at a moment's notice due to this fear. As she and SÅ�ta usually share shifts, he takes the brunt of her attacks. However, she makes considerable progress with her fear of men by taking it out on SÅ�ta. She wears a hairpin in her hair, which she changes every day due to SÅ�ta's compliment on it (according to SÅ�ma). At first she begins to develop a crush, but later she falls in love with SÅ�ta when he confronts her father (as Kotori) about her androphobia. Thanks to SÅ�ta her condition improved as she states that thanks to him she became able to be about two meters close to guys without having the urge to hit them, though this extends to only having fairly civil conversations (often ruined by SÅ�ta's rudeness) or if Mahiru launches an attack on him. Despite that SÅ�ta only manages to get closer to Mahiru without risk of being attacked when he crossdress as Kotori or by using a grabber toy.
KyÅ�ko Shirafuji (ç™½è—¤ æ��å­�, Shirafuji KyÅ�ko ? )
Voiced by: Kumiko Watanabe , Junko Minagawa (drama CD)
KyÅ�ko is the manager of Wagnaria. She usually maintains a rather apathetic attitude towards the restaurant she runs and almost never bothers to do any work herself, instead constantly eating food including Yachiyo's parfaits and Otoo's souvenirs. She is not beyond using violence to deal with unruly customers and firmly believes that employees come before the customers, as the employees are the ones doing all the work. She is 28 years old, but she becomes despondent whenever she is called old or any variation of. KyÅ�ko was a juvenile delinquent , and Yachiyo and KyÅ�ko met when KyÅ�ko saved Yachiyo from bullies when she was a little girl and demanded food as payment.
Yachiyo Todoroki (è½Ÿ å…«å�ƒä»£, Todoroki Yachiyo ? )
Voiced by: Eri Kitamura , Shiho Kawaragi (drama CD)
Yachiyo is the chief of staff at the restaurant and is 20 years old. She usually carries around a katana which, according to her, was made by her parents who used to be blacksmiths. Yachiyo is unaware that some of the customers, and even SÅ�ta, are intimidated by her blade. She admires KyÅ�ko, considerably after she was saved from bullies by her, and has followed her ever since. She constantly makes parfaits for KyÅ�ko and becomes hostile to anyone else trying to give her food, which is usually Otoo. Yachiyo is very close to Jun, as she has worked with him the longest and considered him her closest friend, as she was unaware of his feelings for her and spent most of her time talking to him about KyÅ�ko, much to his dismay. However, later on she reciprocates his feelings, and they begin dating. In the crossover drama CD bundled with the Servant x Service limited edition Blu-ray/DVDs, she and Jun go together to enter their names into the family register, and instead of babbling about Kyoko to others, she now boasts about her husband Jun. She is often addressed as "Chief" by SÅ�ta.
Jun SatÅ� (ä½�è—¤ æ½¤, SatÅ� Jun ? )
Voiced by: Daisuke Ono , Hirofumi Nojima (drama CD)
A 20-year-old chef who works in the kitchen, Jun is a helpful but intimidating individual. He is in love with Yachiyo, but has problems expressing it. However, because she is so devoted to KyÅ�ko, she failed to recognize any hints he attempts to make. He likes to take out his anger on Popura by messing with her or bending the truth, to which Popura naively believes. When Hiroomi tries to help with Jun's development with Yachiyo, Jun unrelentingly hits him with a pan, showing that he is sensitive about his feelings for Yachiyo. However, later on in the manga, Yachiyo reciprocates his feelings, and they begin dating. In the crossover drama CD bundled with the Servant x Service limited edition Blu-ray/DVDs, she and Jun go together to enter their names into the family register, and after the process is completed, Jun refuses to stop bullying Popura by changing her hairstyle, saying that he is too happy being a newlywed man.
Hiroomi SÅ�ma (ç›¸é¦¬ å�šè‡£, SÅ�ma Hiroomi ? )
Voiced by: Hiroshi Kamiya , Yoshinori Fujita (drama CD)
Another chef who works in the kitchen, Hiroomi is a young man with an easygoing attitude. He often blackmails other workers to do his job for him and pass it off as a form of modesty from the other employees. He can blackmail anyone except for Jun and Mahiru; the former usually responds to his blackmail with hitting him with a frying pan and the latter punches him even before he manages to talk to her. He is terrified of Mahiru's urges and is thankful for SÅ�ta's existence in the restaurant since she takes out all her urges on him instead. His biggest weakness appears to be crying girls. Moreover, Aoi has been the only person to ever backfire his blackmails, leaving him depressed. However, he somewhat dotes on Aoi, trying to protect her whereabouts from her brother and buying her Aoi's most beloved possession, a stuffed bear named Daisy.
Aoi Yamada (å±±ç”° è‘µ, Yamada Aoi ? )
Voiced by: RyÅ� Hirohashi , Kana Ueda (drama CD)
Aoi is a mysterious, self-proclaimed 16-year-old girl who Otoo meets on his travels to find his missing wife. Her true identity and age are a mystery besides the fact that her first name is Aoi. He brings her back to Wagnaria where she starts working as a waitress and lives in Wagnaria's attic. While she has great confidence in herself, during work she is an unhelpful troublemaker who gets yelled at by the other staff members, especially SÅ�ta. Since she is in training, her position among the staff is low, which she complains about. She is bad with dealing with SÅ�ta's constant complaints about her, but she does write down some of his suggestions (along with idle complaints). She yearns for the idea of having a family, especially towards Otoo whom she sees as an ideal father figure. She goes as far as to apply to be adopted by him. She is also rather childish and does not like to be (in her view) "left out", in that sense she goes so as far so as to ask KyÅ�ko to drive her home (even though she "lives" at Wagnaria) or ask for SÅ�ma to poke her, as he and SatÅ� poked Inami and Popura. Her favorite food is nattÅ� . Her ladylike manner and lack of knowledge in the kitchen makes Takanashi suspect she is actually from a rich family. Later on, her brother appears looking for her, but SÅ�ma continues to prevent them from meeting. After the two eventually do meet, Aoi states that she ran away partly due to her family situation, her father had died and her mother is described as 'robotic', but largely because Kirio had eaten the nattÅ� she had been saving in the fridge one day.
HyÅ�go Otoo (éŸ³å°¾ å…µå�¾, Otoo HyÅ�go ? )
Voiced by: JÅ�ji Nakata , Daiki Nakamura (drama CD)
Otoo is the top head of the restaurant. Most of the time he is away searching for his missing wife, who apparently is so bad with directions she got lost while running errands and is now lost wandering Japan. He periodically returns to Wagnaria to check up on things and bring back souvenirs. Due to his habit of bringing food back for KyÅ�ko whenever he returns, his life is constantly in danger from a jealous Yachiyo. He is noted to have a light presence, and is even compared to (and named) "air" by SÅ�ta when the latter is attempting to convince Mahiru not to attack him. He finally reunites with his wife, and they are now living together once again. He keeps a very close watch on her so that she will not get lost again.
Maya Matsumoto (æ�¾æœ¬ éº»è€¶, Matsumoto Maya ? )
Voiced by: Akiko Kawase
Maya is an 18-year-old glasses-wearing girl who works at Wagnaria. She professes that she is a "normal person" striving to be completely ordinary in work and life in general. She has a hard time understanding the other employees seeing how awkward all of them are and tries not to be too familiar with them. The irony is that because she tries too hard to be "normal", she ends up being pretty weird herself. Maya briefly appeared in volume one of the manga and did not resurface until volume five due to readers requesting more information on her from the author.[ citation needed ]
