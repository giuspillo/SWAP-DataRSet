The Mothman Prophecies is a 1975 book by John Keel.
Synopsis
The book relates Keel's account of his investigation into alleged sightings of a large, winged creature called Mothman in the vicinity of Point Pleasant, West Virginia , during 1966 and 1967. [2] It combines these investigations with his own theories about UFOs and various supernatural phenomena, ultimately connecting them to the December 15, 1967, collapse of the Silver Bridge across the Ohio River (which had already been known to have been caused by stress corrosion cracking in an eyebar in a suspension chain as early as 1971 [3] ).
