Plot introduction
Fancy Nancy is a young girl with a larger than life personality, who adores all things fancy. She always dresses extravagantly, wearing boas , tutus , ruby slippers , fairy wings, and fuzzy slippers. Nancy loves using big fancy words such as "iridescent", "ecstatic", and "extraordinary" and anything in French . [1] [3] She has redecorated her bedroom with everyday items, such as feather boas, Christmas lights, paper flowers, and hats. Her favorite doll is named Marabelle Lavinia Chandelier. [4]
Nancy captures hearts by nearly getting caught up in the glitter, but, in the end, always discovering what's truly important.

In Nancy's opinion, her family is ordinary and dresses rather plainly, so Nancy decides to hold a class in the art of fanciness for her family. They oblige, and Nancy helps to dress them in bows, ornaments, top hats, and gaudy scarves. "Ooo-la-la!" Nancy cries in delight. "My family is posh! That's a fancy word for fancy." [4]
Jane O'Connor
Jane O'Connor is vice-president and editor-at-large for Penguin Books for Young Readers! [5] She has written more than thirty children's books. Her first adult novel, Dangerous Admissions: Secrets of a Closet Sleuth came out in July 2007. [5]
O'Connor came up with Fancy Nancy on a summer evening. As she describes it, "It was after dinner one evening that the title just came to me," she recalls. "I sat down and wrote the first and last paragraphs. The rest of the story took me awhile, but the beginning and the end just flew into my head." [2] [5] O'Connor is quick to point out that much of the book's success is Glasser's artwork. She wrote the book in 2002, but it didn't come out until 2005, because her editor, Margaret Anastas, insisted on Glasser as the illustrator who was busy with other projects. [3] [5]
Robin Preiss Glasser
Robin Preiss Glasser has had two successful careers, the first as a ballet dancer and the second as an award-winning childrenâ€™s book illustrator. After an 11-year career as soloist with the Pennsylvania Ballet, Glasser returned to school at age 30 to receive her BFA from Parsons The New School for Design. Among the noted authors and personalities for whom Glasser has illustrated best-selling childrenâ€™s books are Judith Viorst, radio star Garrison Keillor, poet Elizabeth Garton Scanlon, and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Glasser received an ALA Notable Book Award for You Canâ€™t Take a Balloon into the Metropolitan Museum with author Jacqueline Preiss Weitzman, and collaborated on three books with the former vice presidentâ€™s wife, Lynne Cheney ( America, A Patriotic Primer; A is for Abigail; and Our 50 States), which together sold more than 1 million copies.
In 2005 Glasser was paired with author Jane Oâ€™Connor for the now classic Fancy Nancy. The Children's Book Council named her 2013 Illustrator of the Year for Fancy Nancy and the Mermaid Ballet after more than 1 million young people cast their votes [6] in the 6th annual Children's Choice Book Awards.
