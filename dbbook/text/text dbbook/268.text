My Utmost for His Highest is a daily devotional by Oswald Chambers (1874-1917) that compiles his Christian preaching to students and soldiers. The book was first published in 1924, later undergoing a revision in the 1990s, and has become a series of Christian devotional journals, calendars, and children's books. The title is taken from one of Chambers's sermons, where he says "Shut out every consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only- My Utmost for His Highest". The book is considered to be one of the most popular religious books ever written, inspiring several people such as author Cal Thomas and President George W. Bush. My Utmost for His Highest has been officially translated into over 39 languages, including Spanish and Afrikaans.
