Plot Summary
A young boy, Gregor, and his baby sister, Boots, who are residents of a New York City apartment, find that in their apartment complex's laundry room is an entrance to the Underland; a world containing no natural light, filled with humans with translucent skin, giant bats, snails, moles, scorpions, cockroaches, rats, lizards, mice, ants, snakes, fireflies, and spiders which they call fliers, slimers, diggers, stingers, crawlers, gnawers, hissers, nibblers, cutters, twisters, shiners, and spinners, respectively, and more unusual things you would not normally come in contact with in the Overland. Gregor does everything he can to get himself and his sister home... but when the humans of the Underland reveal that Gregor is the "Warrior" foretold in prophecy, Gregor goes on an epic journey to get hold of the Underland's human inhabitants and their world as they know it.

The Prophecy of Gray
"Beware, Underlanders, time hangs by a thread
The hunters are hunted, white water runs red.
The gnawers will strike to extinguish the rest.
The hope of the hopeless resides in a quest.
An Overlander Warrior, a son of the sun,
May bring us back light, he may bring us back none.
But gather your neighbors and follow his call
or rats will most surely devour us all.
Two over, two under, of royal descent,
Two fliers, two crawlers, two spinners assent.
One gnawer beside and one lost up ahead.
And eight will be left when we count up the dead.
The last who will die must decide where he stands.
The fate of the eight is contained in his hands.
So bid him take care, bid him look where he leaps,
As life may be death, and death life again reaps."

Groups
The creatures in the series resemble their real-life counterparts in almost every way, aside from being very large (most of them being bigger than the humans) and able to speak in English.
Crawlers (Cockroaches): They are said to be cowardly and are not treated well by the other species. They call Boots "Princess".
Spinners (Spiders): They provide several types of silk.
Fliers (Bats): Fliers are on very good terms with humans. They go on quests together, protect each other, and sleep
in the same rooms. These creatures "bond" with their human counterparts in a very special ceremony.
Gnawers (Rats): They are the penurious of the story. Most of the Gnawers are rude and unmannerly.
Shiners (Fireflies): All Shiners eat too much, are lazy and unreliable. A Shiner who has left more than enough food for others is unheard
of. Most Shiners are competitive with one another. Introduced in book 2.
Nibblers (Mice): Are allied to the humans. Introduced in book 3.
Stingers (Scorpions): Are allied by the humans by book 4.
Diggers (Moles): Introduced in book 5. They are the true founders of the Underland. Gregor discovers that when Bartholomew of Sandwich decided to settle, he tried to kill all the Diggers in order to have the land he wanted. This is the biggest reason humans are called "Killers", as this was the Underland's first impression of them.
Twisters (Snakes): Introduced in book 4.
Hissers (Lizards): Introduced in book 3.
Cutters (Ants): Enemies of all warmbloods (as opposed to coldbloods). Introduced in book 3.
