Dead Man's Folly is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first published in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in October 1956 and in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on November 5 of the same year. The US edition retailed at $2.95 and the UK edition at twelve shillings and sixpence (12/6). It features Hercule Poirot, her famous Belgian detective, and Ariadne Oliver. The house where the story is set was based on Christie's Devon home, Greenway House on the Greenway Estate.
Plot summary
Poirot is summoned to Nasse House in Devon by Ariadne Oliver, who is staging a Murder Hunt as part of activities in a summer fÃªte the next day. At Nasse House, Mrs. Oliver explains that small aspects of her plans for the Murder Hunt have been changed by requests from people in the house rather deviously, until a real murder would not surprise her.
The owner of Nasse House is George Stubbs, a wealthy man who has adopted the title of "Sir". His much younger wife is the beautiful Hattie, Lady Stubbs. She shows interest in fine clothes and jewellery, appearing simple to all but her husband's secretary. Hattie was introduced to him a year earlier by Amy Folliat, the surviving member of the family who owned the estate for centuries. Widowed, she lost her two sons during the War. With death duties very high post-war, she had to sell the ancestral home and grounds to keep it intact. [3] She took on the orphaned Hattie, introducing her in society. Mrs. Folliat rents the lodge on the estate. Michael Weyman, an architect, is on site to design a tennis court; he criticises the inappropriate location of a recently built folly . Sir George shouts at young tourists who cross his property in hopes of a short cut across his estate to the river ferry, including a Dutch woman, an Italian woman, and a man wearing a shirt decorated with turtles.
On the day of the fÃªte, Hattie reads out a letter from her cousin, Etienne de Sousa, who will visit that day; she is upset by his abrupt visit. A local Girl Guide , Marlene Tucker, plays the part of the victim in the Murder Hunt; she waits in the boathouse to pose as the dead victim when a player finds the key to enter. Her first visitor is Miss Brevis with a tray of refreshments at tea time at Hattie's request. In the company of Mrs. Oliver, Poirot discovers the corpse of Marlene in the boathouse. Hattie cannot be found. Mrs. Oliver produces an abundance of theories to explain the murder and the disappearance, while the police and Poirot narrow the field from all attending the fÃªte, to those familiar with the Murder Hunt.
The investigation focuses first on Etienne de Sousa and briefly on Amanda Brewis. Further confusion is added by the behaviour of the Legges, staying in a cottage on the estate and whose marriage is in trouble due to his behaviour. He has a shady connection with the young man in a turtle shirt. (This red herring is connected with Legge's early political leanings in his career as an "atom scientist".)
With weeks of no progress, Poirot visits Devon again, learning that Hattie is still missing and Merdell, the old boatman, dead by accident was Marlene's grandfather. He puts together several stray clues: Marlene's grandfather had seen a woman's body in the woods; she received small sums of money used to make small purchases, now in her younger sister's possession; Merdell had commented to Poirot that there would "always be Folliats at Nasse House". Now it is three murders, Poirot tells the police, who find the evidence to support his solution.
In the dÃ©nouement , Poirot explains all in a conversation with Mrs. Folliat, who knows more than she has let on. Sir George Stubbs is really Mrs. Folliat's younger son, James, a war deserter. Amy had paired him with the orphan young woman Hattie, who gained her wealth on her marriage, not penniless as Mrs. Folliat first said. James fleeced Hattie of her money to establish his new identity and to purchase the old family home, all of which his mother was aware. Unknown, however, to Mrs. Folliat, James had married a young Italian woman after deserting the war. The evening he and Hattie came to Nasse House was the real Hattie's only time there. James killed her, and his legal first wife played the role of Hattie from the next morning. The real Hattie is buried on the grounds.
George/James and his first wife eliminated all who might reveal their true identities. Marlene Tucker learned the true identity of George Stubbs from her grandfather, so both were murdered, separately. The day before the fÃªte, the first wife took on another identity as an Italian tourist staying in the nearby hostel. She switches between the two roles frequently over 24 hours. The fake Hattie sends Miss Brewis to bring refreshments to Marlene shortly before the girl was murdered. She kills Marlene then changes to the tourist guise, tossing the large hat she wore as Hattie in the river. Then James's wife leaves the area as the Italian tourist with a rucksack. The day of Marlene's murder had been selected to cast suspicion upon Etienne, who had written weeks earlier of his visit, as he told Inspector Bland. Having grown up with the real Hattie, Etienne would not have been fooled, despite the many years that had passed since he last saw her. Two weeks later, Merdell was drowned at the river by James.
Neither the arrests of the culprits nor whether the despairing Mrs. Folliat herself faces any legal charges is mentioned. The story ends with the sounds of the police smashing up the Folly to locate and exhume Hattie's body.

Literary significance and reception
Anthony Quinton began his review column in the Times Literary Supplement of 21 December 1956, writing, "Miss Agatha Christie's new Poirot story comes first in this review because of this author's reputation and not on its own merits, which are disappointingly slight. They consist almost wholly in the appearance yet once more of certain profoundly familiar persons, scenes and devices. Poirot is on hand with his superb English, based, one supposes, on the middle line in the French lessons in the Children's Encyclopaedia, but the little grey cells are rather subdued." He set up the basics of the plot and then continued, "The solution is of the colossal ingenuity we have been conditioned to expect but a number of the necessary red herrings are either unexplained or a little too grossly ad hoc. People are never candid about their vices so there is no need to take seriously the protestations of detective addicts about their concern with the sheer logic of their favourite reading. What should be the real appeal of Dead Man's Folly, however, is not much better than its logic. The scene is really excessively commonplace, there are too many characters and they are very, very flat." [4]
The anonymous review in The Times of 15 November 1956, was also somewhat damning; "Dead Man's Folly is not Miss Agatha Christie at her best. The murder and the solution of it are ingenious, but then, with Miss Christie, they always are, and it is pleasant to watch M. Hercule Poirot at work again. The character drawing is flat and facile, however, and the dialogue, always Miss Christie's weak point, disastrous." [5]
Maurice Richardson of The Observer (18 November 1956) pointed out the similarity between the house portrayed in the book and Christie's own and summed up, "Stunning but not unguessable solution. Nowhere near a vintage Christie but quite a pleasing table-read." [6]
Robert Barnard : "Highly traditional recipe, but not done with the same conviction as in the thirties. Nobody much is what they seem, and old sins cast long shadows. Mrs Oliver looms large here, as she was frequently to do from now on, both in Poirot books and in others." [7]
Film, TV or theatrical adaptations
First adapted to film with Peter Ustinov and Jean Stapleton starring as Poirot and Oliver in a 1986 adaptation set in the present-day. It was shot largely on location at West Wycombe Park in Buckinghamshire.
John Moffatt starred as Poirot in the BBC Radio 4 dramatisation broadcast in 2007, with Julia McKenzie as Ariadne Oliver.
The novel was adapted with David Suchet as Poirot, as part of the series of Agatha Christie's Poirot . [8] It guest-starred Sean Pertwee (Sir George Stubbs), Stephanie Leonidas (Hattie Stubbs), SinÃ©ad Cusack (Amy Folliat), Rebecca Front (Amanda Brewis), Tom Ellis (D.I. Bland), Martin Jarvis (Captain Warburton), Rosalind Ayres (Mrs Warburton), and ZoÃ« Wanamaker in her sixth and final appearance as Ariadne Oliver . This was the last episode of the series to be filmed (although not the last to air), with production completed in June 2013. [9] [10] The telefilm was shot mainly at Agatha Christie's home, Greenway Estate , the setting she used, along with its old boathouse on the River Dart, for the novel.
The adaptation has some differences from the novel as written by Christie. The setting is moved from the early 1950s to the late 1930s; accordingly, James Folliat â€“ a war deserter in the novel â€“ is here a wayward womaniser whom Mrs Folliat sends to South Africa, where he fakes his death in an aviation accident and returns to Nasse in the identity of Sir George Stubbs. Mrs Masterton becomes Mrs Warburton, Captain Warburton's wife; Marlene's sister, Marilyn, becomes an older sister named Gertie, but serves the same function as Marilyn in the novel; the characters of George the valet, Miss Lemon, the turtle-shirted man, and Marlene's parents are deleted. The adaption ends with Mrs Folliat and her son together off-screen with two gunshots heard. Poirot both acknowledges and approves of this murder-suicide with the final word of the episode: "Bon". This is a change from the novel, which ends with the police digging up the folly foundations, and leaves the ultimate fate of the Folliats untold.
