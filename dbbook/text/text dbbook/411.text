"A Trip to Amsterdam"
by Gorg Huff and Paula Goodlett
This vignette by Gorg Huff and Paula Goodlett returns to the story of the two groups maturing of tycoons known respectively as the Sewing Circle and the Barbie Consortium introduced initially in the "The Sewing Circle" , continued again in "Other Peopleâ€™s Money" , and other seminal background tales.
"This'll Be the Day..."
by Walt Boyes
The story recounts the deeds of Father Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld on the day of his former death.
"Command Performance"
by David Carrico
This continuation of the "Franz and Marla" stories by David Carrico, ties in with a brief mention of the story behind and within the concert as told here. The same tale, from a different prospective was used as background for the entrance of Admiral John Simpson and wife Mary as they come on stage during the end of the industrial disaster that begins the novel 1634: The Baltic War .
As a continuation and perhaps climax of the Franz and Marla saga, the tale reveals Marla in a triumphal debut among the rich and famous in Magdeburg , while the lovable and tragic Franz finds a new musical grooveâ€”and is able to play again publicly â€” while, finally, proving worthy in his own eyes of "getting the girl". Like the preceding Franz and Marla stories, it is an excellent tale told with skill and is good at evoking emotions and painting complex characters undergoing lives' pressures.
