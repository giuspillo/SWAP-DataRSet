Controversy
Attempts have been made to ban the book from some libraries, parents claiming that the poem "How Not To Have To Dry The Dishes" encourages messiness and disobedience. [1] The poem "Little Abigail and the Beautiful Pony" led to more criticism for describing the death of a girl after her parents refuse to buy her a pony. This led the book to be banned by the Fruitland Park Elementary School in Lake County, Florida . [2] The decision, however, was later reversed by an advisory committee of parents and teachers. [3] Other complaints included the mention of supernatural themes, including demons , devils , and ghosts . [3]
