Summary
The book begins when Percy Jackson, a 12 year old boy with dyslexia, ADHD, saying that he has been expelled from every school he has ever attended. When his class of Yancy Academy takes a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, his pre-algebra teacher Mrs. Dodds transforms into one of the three Furies of Greek legend and attacks him. Percy's Latin teacher Mr. Brunner throws Percy a magic sword named Anaklusmos or Riptide, and sends Mrs. Dodds to Tartarus . When Percy comes out, he finds that nobody remembers Mrs. Dodds, and Mr. Brunner acts the same, and his best friend Grover Underwood acting strangely.
When Percy and his mother, Sally, go to Montauk beach in New York, Grover comes to tell them to leave immediately. They drive away in a horrible storm, and a Minotaur takes Sally in a blinding flash of light. In anger, Percy kills the Minotaur and takes one of its horns. He wakes up three days later, healed by nectar and ambrosia , at Camp Half-Blood . Grover reveals himself to be a satyr , and Mr. Brunner reveals himself to be Chiron the centaur . As nobody knows who Percy's godly father is, he is placed in the Hermes (the god of messengers, travelers, and thieves) cabin. At camp he meets Luke, son of Hermes, Annabeth Stone, daughter of Athena, and Clarisse, daughter of Ares. After several water-related incidents, a trident mark appears above Percy's head. This is revealed to be his father, Poseidon .
The Oracle tells Percy to find the stolen master lightning bolt of Zeus, because Zeus thinks that Percy is to blame for stealing the lightning bolt. After defeating several monsters including Mrs. Dodds, Medusa, and a chimera they find Hades, who actually took Sally. Apparently, his helm of darkness (his symbol of power) seems to have been stolen too. Hades also blames Percy for stealing his helm and wants to kill Percy and his mother and release all the dead back into the real world. They use magical pearls, a gift from a Myriad the sea messenger, to save themselves from Hades and discover that Ares actually has the bolt. Percy challenges Ares to a duel and wins, to his own surprise. Lord Hades realizes that Percy did not steal his helm of darkness, and returns Sally safely.
After the bolt is given back to Zeus, Luke is revealed to be the lightning thief and the number one servant of the Lord of the Titans , Kronos the father of Olympians and son of Gaia , the earth, and Uranus , the sky. Luke tries to kill Percy by calling on a pit scorpion, but luckily Percy manages to kill it. Unfortunately, Luke had gotten away. Lastly, Percy decides to spend the school year with Sally.
Development and publication
Rick Riordan, the author, at the release of The Battle of the Labyrinth
Development for both The Lightning Thief and the Percy Jackson series began when Riordan began making stories for his son Haley who had been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia . His son had been studying Greek mythology in second grade and asked that his father come up with bedtime stories based on Greek myths. Riordan had been a Greek mythology teacher in middle school for many years and was able to remember enough stories to please his son. Soon Riordan ran out of myths and his son requested that Riordan make new ones using the characters from Greek myths while adding some new ones. Riordan created the fictional character Percy Jackson and his travels across the United States to recover Zeus's lightning bolt. After Riordan finished telling the story his son asked that his dad write a book based on Percy's adventures. [7]
While he gave his manuscript to his agent and editor to review, Riordan took his book to a group of 6th, 7th, and 8th graders to read and give their critique. Ultimately he gained their approval and, with their help came up with the name of the book and created the way Percy's sword worked. [8] In 2004 the book was sold to Miramax Books for enough money that Riordan could quit his job to focus on writing. [9] After it was released on July 28, 2005, it sold over 1.2 million copies. The book was released in multiple versions including hardcover, paperback, and audio editions [10] [11] and has been translated into multiple languages and published all over the world. [12]
