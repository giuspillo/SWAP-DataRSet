Wolf's Head, Wolf's Heart is the second book in the Firekeeper Saga by Jane Lindskold.
Plot summary
Brought up by intelligent language-using Royal wolves, Firekeeper was found by humans and has yet to learn of human politics, diplomacy and more. Her other name is 'Lady Blysse'.
After the three artifacts of magical value are stolen by Queen Valora, things start to go wrong. Princess Sapphire and Prince Shad are almost assassinated at their wedding, and in the ensuing battle between loyal subjects of the monarchs and the assassins, Firekeeper successfully manages to capture one of the assassins.
Lady Melina Shield, who longs for the artifacts, has sorcery in her control. As soon as Baron Endbrook from Queen Valora comes to bear her a message, she leaves Citrine, her daughter, as a hostage in his care and goes off after the artifacts. However, she is not interested in them for the good of her kingdom - she is interested because they would give her greater power.
Firekeeper returns to her pack of wolves after an urgent summoning, and her friends Lady Elise, Sir Jared and Derian watch over the court, uncovering a plan of treason by Melina Shield.
In the end, Firekeeper retrieves the artifacts, but breaks them just in case anybody would use them for evil purposes. Afterwards, Firekeeper, along with the aid of her friends and the newly forming kingdom of Bright Haven, join together to save young Citrine from Baron Endbrook. Unfortunately, by the time they rescue Citrine, she has already gone insane since Baron Endbrook cut the two smallest fingers off her left hand.
