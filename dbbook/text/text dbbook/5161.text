The Abominable Man
Murder at the Savoy (Polis, polis, potatismos! literally Police, Police, Mashed Potatoes!) is a Swedish crime novel and the sixth book out of ten in the ' Martin Beck ' detective series by SjÃ¶wall and WahlÃ¶Ã¶ revolving around police detective Martin Beck.
Title
"Murder at the Savoy" is the English title of the novel. The Swedish title of the book, meaning "Police, police, mashed potatoes", is explained in a scene where Gunvald Larsson is telling off the miserably lazy policemen Kristiansson and Kvant. The two policemen had, instead of obeying their orders to arrest a suspect at Arlanda Airport , been arguing with a man whose 3-year-old son had shouted "Police, police, mashed potatoes" at the two policemen while they were eating Hot Dog with mashed potatoes at a grill bar. This refers to the common rhyme "polis polis potatisgris" ("police, police, potato pig").
Plot
Martin Beck has to search through the high powered business man Viktor Palmgren's many enemies when the business man is shot in front of a dozen witnesses at a high-end restaurant.
