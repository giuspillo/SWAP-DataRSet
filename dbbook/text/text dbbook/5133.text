Wheelock's Latin, is a comprehensive beginning Latin textbook. Chapters introduce related grammatical topics and assume little or no prior knowledge of Latin grammar or language. Each chapter has a collection of translation exercises created specifically for the book or taken directly from ancient sources. Those coming from Roman authors and historians (called Sententiae Antiquae—lit. , "old sentences" or "ancient thoughts") may be either direct quotations or may be paraphrased from the original document. Interspersed in the text are introductions to Ancient Roman culture. At the end of each chapter is a section called "Latina Est Gaudium — Et Utilis!", which literally means "Latin Is Fun — And Useful!" This section gives the student phrases which can be used to make a conversation (such as "Quid Agis Hodie?", which means "How are you today?"), and notes about how some English words relate to Latin. It is currently in its 7th edition.
