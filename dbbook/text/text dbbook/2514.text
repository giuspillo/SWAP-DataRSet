Think and Grow Rich is a 1937 motivational personal development and self-help book by Napoleon Hill and inspired by a suggestion from Scottish-American businessman Andrew Carnegie. While the title implies that this book deals with how to get rich, the author explains that the philosophy taught in the book can be used to help people succeed in all lines of work and to do or be almost anything they want. Jim Murray (sportswriter) wrote that Think and Grow Rich was credited for Ken Norton's boxing upset of Muhammad Ali in 1973. The Reverend Charles Stanley writes, "I began to apply the principles of (Think and Grow Rich) to my endeavors as a pastor, and I discovered they worked!" The book was first published during the Great Depression. At the time of Hill's death in 1970, Think and Grow Rich had sold more than 70 million copies worldwide. It remains the biggest seller of Napoleon Hill's books. BusinessWeek Magazine's Best-Seller List ranked the sixth best-selling paperback business book 70 years after it was published. Think and Grow Rich is listed in John C. Maxwell's A Lifetime "Must Read" Books List.
Content
The text of Think and Grow Rich is founded on Hill's earlier work The Law of Success , the result of more than twenty years of research based on Hill's close association with a large number of individuals who achieved great wealth during their lifetimes. [6]
At Andrew Carnegie's bidding, Hill studied the characteristics of these achievers and developed 16 "laws" of success meant to be applied by people to achieve success. Think and Grow Rich condenses these laws further and provides the reader with 13 principles in the form of a philosophy of personal achievement. [6] International Speaker Mark Victor Hansen says time has proven 2 of the laws/principles to be most important: 1) The MasterMind principle/process and 2) "Know very clearly where you want to go."
It is noted in the book that an individual with desire, faith and persistence can reach great heights by eliminating negative energy and thoughts and focusing on the greater goals in hand.
The 13 "steps" listed in the book are: 1. Desire 2. Faith 3. Autosuggestion 4. Specialized Knowledge 5. Imagination 6. Organized Planning 7. Decision 8. Persistence 9. Power of the Master Mind 10. The Mystery of Sex Transmutation 11. The Subconscious Mind 12. The Brain 13. The Sixth Sense
