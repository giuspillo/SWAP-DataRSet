Murder on the Orient Express is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie featuring the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. It was first published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club on January 1, 1934 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year under the title of Murder in the Calais Coach. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00. The US title of Murder on the Train was used to avoid confusion with the 1932 Graham Greene novel Stamboul Train which had been published in the US as Orient Express.
Reception
The Times Literary Supplement of 11 January 1934 outlined the plot and concluded that "The little grey cells solve once more the seemingly insoluble. Mrs. Christie makes an improbable tale very real, and keeps her readers enthralled and guessing to the end." [6]
In The New York Times Book Review of 4 March 1934, Isaac Anderson wrote, "The great Belgian detective's guesses are more than shrewd; they are positively miraculous. Although both the murder plot and the solution verge upon the impossible, Agatha Christie has contrived to make them appear quite convincing for the time being, and what more than that can a mystery addict desire?" [7]
The reviewer in The Guardian of 12 January 1934 stated that the murder would have been "perfect" had Poirot not been on the train and also overheard a conversation between Miss Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot before he boarded; however, "The 'little grey cells' worked admirably, and the solution surprised their owner as much as it may well surprise the reader, for the secret is well kept and the manner of the telling is in Mrs. Christie's usual admirable manner." [8]
Robert Barnard : "The best of the railway stories. The Orient Express, snowed up in Yugoslavia , provides the ideal 'closed' set-up for a classic-style exercise in detection, as well as an excuse for an international cast-list. Contains my favourite line in all Christie: 'Poor creature, she's a Swede.' Impeccably clued, with a clever use of the Cyrillic script (cf. The Double Clue ). The solution raised the ire of Raymond Chandler , but won't bother anyone who doesn't insist his detective fiction mirror real-life crime." [9] The reference is to Chandler's criticism of Christie in his essay The Simple Art of Murder .
References and allusions
Main article: Lindbergh kidnapping
The Armstrong kidnapping case was based on the actual kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh 's son in 1932, just before the book was written. A maid employed by Mrs. Lindbergh's parents was suspected of involvement in the crime. After being harshly interrogated by police, she committed suicide. Another less-remembered real-life event also helped inspire the novel. Agatha Christie first travelled on the Orient Express in the autumn of 1928. Just a few months later, in February 1929, an Orient Express train was trapped by a blizzard near Cherkeskoy , Turkey, remaining marooned for six days. [10]
Christie herself was involved in a similar incident in December 1931 while returning from a visit to her husband's archaeological dig at Nineveh . The Orient Express train she was on was stuck for 24 hours due to rainfall, flooding, and sections of the track being washed away. Her authorised biography quotes in full a letter to her husband detailing the event. The letter includes descriptions of some passengers on the train, who influenced the plot and characters of the book, particularly an American lady, Mrs. Hilton, who was the inspiration for Mrs. Hubbard. [11]
Radio
John Moffatt starred as Poirot in a five-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation by Michael Blakewell, which was directed by Enyd Williams and originally broadcast from 28 December 1992 - 1 January 1993. AndrÃ© Maranne appeared as Bouc, Joss Ackland as Ratchett, Sylvia Syms as Mrs. Hubbard, SiÃ¢n Phillips as Princess Dragomiroff, Francesca Annis as Mary Debenham, and Peter Polycarpou as Dr. Constantine.
Murder on the Orient Express (1974)
The book was made into a 1974 movie, which is considered one of the most successful cinematic adaptations of Christie's work ever. The film starred Albert Finney as Poirot, Martin Balsam as M. Bianchi (not Bouc), George Coulouris as Dr. Constantine, Richard Widmark as Ratchett, and an all-star cast of suspects including Sean Connery , Lauren Bacall , Anthony Perkins , John Gielgud , Michael York , Jean-Pierre Cassel , Jacqueline Bisset , Wendy Hiller , Vanessa Redgrave , Rachel Roberts , Colin Blakely , Denis Quilley , and Ingrid Bergman (who won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Greta Ohlsson).
Only minor changes were made for the film: Masterman was renamed Beddoes, the dead maid was named Paulette instead of Susanne, Helena Goldenberg became Helena GrÃ¼nvald (which is German for "Greenwood"), Antonio Foscarelli became Gino Foscarelli, Caroline Martha Hubbard became Harriet Belinda Hubbard, and the train line's Belgian/Flemish director, Monsieur Bouc, became instead an Italian director, Signor Bianchi.
Murder on the Orient Express (2001)
A thoroughly modernised and poorly received made-for-TV version starring Alfred Molina as Poirot was presented by CBS in 2001. This version, which costarred Meredith Baxter as Mrs. Hubbard, even implied that a woman was romantically interested in Poirot, had fewer suspects, and did away completely with the elegant clothing styles of the novel and the 1974 film. [12]
Poirot: Murder on the Orient Express (2010)
David Suchet reprises the role of Hercule Poirot in the television series co-produced by ITV Studios and WGBH-TV . The original air date was 11 July 2010 in the United States, and it was aired on Christmas Day 2010 in the UK.
The cast includes Dame Eileen Atkins , Hugh Bonneville , Jessica Chastain , Barbara Hershey , Toby Jones , and David Morrissey . Loosely faithful to the original story, it has a number of differences. Cyrus Hardman is omitted from the story, with Dr. Constantine taking his place among the "jury," as he was Mrs. Armstrong's American (instead of Greek) doctor who delivered Daisy Armstrong and the second (stillborn) child. Antonio Foscarelli becomes the lover of the maid, as well as being the chauffeur. The dead maid's name is changed from Susanne to Francoise. Most notably, instead of each member of the "jury" coming to Ratchett's compartment during the night and stabbing him one at a time, they line up and stab him one after the other, resulting in him dying from the sheer quantity of wounds sustained, rather than leaving any ambiguity about which one of the jury struck the fatal blow.
Greta Ohlsson (who in the novel was said to be a middle-aged lady) is changed to be a young girl in her early 20s, like Mary and Helena. There is a resemblance among the three girls, implying that they all were sisters of Mrs. Armstrong and daughters of Linda Arden. There is also a discreetly implied romance between Greta and Antonio, as the two are seen together on several occasions towards the end of the film. Finally, the film takes place in January 1938, just before the outbreak of the Second World War, instead of 1936 as in most of the other episodes of the TV series. The atmosphere of this movie is unusually grim and gloomy, compared to other episodes in this series.
Following a trend of religious elements introduced into the series after 2003, the script includes extended religious and moral dialogues, including Ratchett showing himself to be religious, telling Poirot that he wants to make amends for something unknown and feeling remorse for the evil he has done. Other deviations from the novel include scenes of the stoning of an adulteress on the streets of Istanbul witnessed by Poirot, Arbuthnot and Mary Debenham. Mary is paralysed in her right arm and shoulder due to a brutal injury given to her by Ratchett during Daisy's kidnapping. It is revealed that Ratchett's connections threatened to kill MacQueen if his father did not rig the trial. The adaptation is unusual in that the narrative begins with Poirot in the midst of solving his recent case in Palestine , referring to a case mentioned in the book. It is revealed that a woman was found dead with a broken neck, but it was not murder; a married soldier was dating her, gave false information to the detectives, and ended up committing suicide to avoid bringing disgrace upon his wife and his regiment. Helena's maiden name, along with that of their mother's name, is changed from Goldenberg to Wasserstein (German for "water stone"), then anglicised to Waterston. In the 1974 movie directed by Sidney Lumet , it had been GrÃ¼nwald (German for "Greenwood"). Mrs. Hubbard/Linda Arden wears a black wig to hide her grey hair, as there was a danger of her being recognised.
The adaptation's ending also has a character very different from that of the original story, with an emphasis on Poirot's moral dilemma. Poirot stubbornly refuses to acknowledge that justice has been done, and gives a fervent speech on the importance of the rule of law, warning that barbarism will prevail if individuals abandon it (apparently alluding to the crimes of the impending Second World War). Greta, whom Poirot admires for her good works and deep faith, firmly tells Poirot that Ratchett's escape from justice is what is wrong with Catholicism, which she says forgives crimes that God will never forgive, and claims she took part in the killing on God's orders. This is followed by an argument between Poirot and Bouc, who is sympathetic to the conspirators' motives. Poirot's refusal to show mercy causes Colonel Arbuthnot to draw a pistol with the intent of killing Poirot and Bouc and blaming it on Ratchett's "assassin", but he is stopped by the others, who force him to see that murdering Poirot and Bouc would make them (the conspirators) no better than Ratchett. This, Poirot's attitude towards the Istanbul stoning, and a conversation with Mary Debenham, culminate in Poirot presenting the police with the false account of the lone assassin. However, he does so far more grudgingly and unwillingly than in the original novel and previous film and television adaptations. The conspirators are relieved, but Poirot continues to struggle with his decision, barely able to hold back his tears as he walks away from the train.
The interior of the Orient Express was reproduced at Pinewood Studios in London , while other locations include the Freemason Hall , Nene Valley Railway, and a street in Malta (shot to represent Istanbul). [13]

The story's first true publication was the US serialisation in six installments in the Saturday Evening Post from 30 September to 4 November 1933 (Volume 206, Numbers 14 to 19). The title was Murder in the Calais Coach, and it was illustrated by William C. Hoople. [14]
The UK serialisation appeared after book publication, appearing in three installments in the Grand Magazine , in March, April, and May 1934 (Issues 349 to 351). This version was abridged from the book version (losing some 25% of the text), was without chapter divisions, and named the Russian princess as Dragiloff instead of Dragomiroff. Advertisements in the back pages of the UK first editions of The Listerdale Mystery , Why Didn't They Ask Evans , and Parker Pyne Investigates claimed that Murder on the Orient Express had proven to be Christie's best-selling book to date and the best-selling book published in the Collins Crime Club series.
The dedication of the book reads:
"To M.E.L.M. Arpachiyah, 1933"
"M.E.L.M." is Christie's second husband, archaeologist Max Edgar Lucien Mallowan (1904â€“78). She dedicated four books to him, either singly or jointly, the others being The Sittaford Mystery (1931), Come Tell Me How You Live (1946), and Christie's final written work, Postern of Fate (1973).
Christie and Mallowan were married, after a short engagement, on 11 September 1930, followed by a honeymoon in Italy. After his final seasons working on someone else's dig ( Reginald Campbell Thompson â€“ see the dedication to Lord Edgware Dies ), Max raised the funds to lead an expedition of his own. With sponsorship from the Trustees of the British Museum and the British School of Archeology in Iraq , [15] he set off in 1933 for a mound at Arpachiyah , north-west of Nineveh , where "after several anxious weeks... considerable quantities of beautifully decorated pottery and figures came to the surface." [16] A notable feature of this season is that, for the first time, Christie, the rank amateur, assisted the professionals in their work. She was responsible for keeping written records and proved highly adept at cleaning and re-assembling pottery fragments. As at Nineveh, she found the time to continue writing, with Orient Express, Why Didn't They Ask Evans, and Unfinished Portrait all being drafted at the dig [16] (although a claim has been made that Murder on the Orient Express was written in the Hotel Pera Palace in Istanbul â€“ see External Links below). Despite this success, after 1933, Mallowan discontinued work in Iraq due to the worsening political situation, and moved on to Syria .
Dustjacket blurb
The blurb on the inside flap of the dust jacket of the first edition (which is also repeated opposite the title page) reads:
The famous Orient Express, thundering along on its three-day journey across Europe, came to a sudden stop in the night. Snowdrifts blocked the line at a desolate spot somewhere in the Balkans. Everything was deathly quiet. "Decidedly I suffer from the nerves," murmured Hercule Poirot, and fell asleep again. He awoke to find himself very much wanted. For in the night murder had been committed. Mr. Ratchett, an American millionaire, was found lying dead in his berth â€“ stabbed. The untrodden snow around the train proved that the murderer was still on board. Poirot investigates. He lies back and thinks â€“ with his little grey cells...
Murder on the Orient Express must rank as one of the most ingenious stories ever devised. The solution is brilliant. One can but admire the amazing resource of Agatha Christie.
