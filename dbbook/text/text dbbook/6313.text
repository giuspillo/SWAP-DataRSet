The Gold Bug Variations is a novel by American writer Richard Powers, first released in 1991.
The novel intertwines the discovery of the chemical structure of DNA with the musicality of Johann Sebastian Bach 's harpsichord composition, the Goldberg Variations . A similar theme is explored by Douglas Hofstadter in his 1979 book GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid . The title also alludes to Edgar Allan Poe's 1843 short story " The Gold-Bug ", which is also incorporated in the plot of the novel. [1]
