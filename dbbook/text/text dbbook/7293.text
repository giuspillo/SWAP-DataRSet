D.N.Angel was adapted into a 26-episode anime series produced by Dentsu and Xebec which aired in Japan on TV Tokyo from April 3 to September 25, 2003. The series was directed by Koji Yoshikawa and Nobuyoshi Habara.
The series was originally licensed for release in North America and the United Kingdom by ADV Films . [7] While in the UK the series is no longer licensed, in North America Discotek Media have announced the rescue-licensing of the series. [8] The series is licensed in Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment . [9]
Five pieces of theme music are used in the anime adaptation. The song "White Night -True Light-" (ç™½å¤œ ã€œTrue Lightã€œ, Byakuya -True Light- ? ), by Shunichi Miyamoto , is used for the opening for twenty four episodes. Vic Mignogna, the English voice actor for Dark Mousy, covered the opening for the English dub. For the ending theme, "Gentle Afternoon" (ã‚„ã�•ã�—ã�„å�ˆå¾Œ, Yasashii Gogo ? ) is used for the first twelve episodes, and "The Day It Begins" (ã�¯ã�˜ã�¾ã‚Šã�®æ—¥, Hajimari no Hi ? ) is used for episodes 13-23 and episode 25. Both songs are performed by Minawo . Episode 24 uses the song "Caged Bird", by Shunichi Miyamoto, for its ending, while the final episode of the series uses Miyamoto's song "Guidepost" (é�“æ¨™, Michishirube ? ).
Video game
A PlayStation 2 video game, D.N.Angel: Kurenai no Tsubasa (DÂ·NÂ·ANGELã€œç´…ã�®ç¿¼ã€œ, DeÄ«.Enu.Enjeru ~Kurenai no Tsubasa~ ? , lit. "D.N.Angel: Crimson Wings"), was published by Takara . The game was released in Japan on September 25, 2003 to coincide with the conclusion of the anime adaptation. However, the game storyline is closer to the manga, and even mentions past events from the manga that would make it inconsistent with the anime.
Drama CDs
A trilogy of drama CDs called D.N.Angel Wink was released in 1999 between March and December. Some of the scenes follow the manga word-for-word, while others have either minor differences or do not appear in the manga at all. The first CD is called "Target: Sleeping Beauty" and was released on March 5, 1999. The second is "2nd Target: Love Sick" and was released on November 17, 1999. The third is "3rd Target: Love Pleasure" and was released on December 15, 1999. There is another CD, "A Legend of a Vampire" that uses the same voice cast as the Wink dramas, though it doesn't relate to the manga. This CD was released in 2001. The plot centers around Daisuke's alter ego, Dark, being a vampire. Krad, who wasn't in the Wink dramas, also made an appearance in this CD.
There were also two drama CDs released after the anime titled "Sweet" and "Cute". These CDs use the anime voice actors and are based on the anime with events taking place just before its ending. They also include parodies of scenes in the anime.
Novels
Three novels were released in Japan between September 2000 and September 2001. The titles are Ningyo no Namida (äººé­šã�®æ¶™ ? , lit. "Mermaid's Tears"), Yuki no Jyoou (é›ªã�®å¥³çŽ‹ ? , lit. "Snow Queen"), and Garasu no Kutsuri (ç¡�å­�ã�®é�´ ? , lit. "Glass Shoes"). Although there was an ad for them left in Tokyopop's translation of the fourth manga volume, they have not been licensed, so little is known about them.
Radio program
A series of seven broadcasts aired Japan in 2005 called Decade on Net: Radio D.N.Angel. It was hosted by Miyu Irino and Akira Ishida , who voiced Daisuke Niwa and Satoshi Hiwatari, respectively.
