Though the stories were largely written in the 1940s while Nin was writing erotica for a private collector, the book was first published posthumously in 1978. In 1995 a film version of the book was directed by Zalman King. There are multiple short stories in this work with certain important characters reappearing throughout. She deals with many different sexual themes, some of them very taboo—including abuse, incest, homosexuality, prostitution, infidelity, and paedophilia—while maintaining the focus of her life's work: the study and description of women.
