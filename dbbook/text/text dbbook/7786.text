The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube by James G. Nourse is a book that was published in 1981. The book explains how to solve the Rubik's Cube. Most of the solutions to Rubik's Cube that can be found on the internet today seem to be based at least in part on the solution in this book. The book's solution to the cube is considered to be one of the easiest, simplest, and most straighforward solutions to solving the cube. However, this ease and simpliciy involves a tradeoff in that this solution takes longer than other solutions that are harder and more complex.
