A Treatise of Human Nature is a book by Scottish philosopher David Hume, first published in 1739–1740. The full title of the Treatise is 'A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to Introduce the Experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects'. It contains the following sections: Book 1: "Of the Understanding" – An investigation into human cognition. Important statements of Skepticism. Book 2: "Of the Passions" – A treatment of emotions and free will. Book 3: "Of Morals" – A treatment of moral ideas, justice, obligations, benevolence.
Pride/humility
Love/hatred
Throughout Book 2, Hume divides the passions into different categories. The calm/violent distinction, which may apply to passions in all categories, is not pictured.
Since we cannot put the feeling of a passion into words , Hume identifies pasÂ­sions via their characteristic causes and effects. The cause of a passion is what calls up the passion: e.g., pride can be caused by one's beautiful house. A cause can be subdivided into the subject itself (e.g., one's house) and the qualÂ­ity of the subject that "operates on the passions" (e.g., the beauty of one's house). The object of a passion is what the passion is ultimately directed at: pride and humility are both directed at oneself. Both object and cause have a foundation in human nature: according to Hume, the object of these passions is fixed by the basic constitution of human psychology (Hume uses the term "original"), whereas their causes are determined by a more general set of adaptable psyÂ­chological mechanisms ("natural" but not original).
Hume's account relies on three mechanisms. First, the "association of ideas": the mind tends to move from one idea to another idea that is naturally related to it. Second, the "association of impressions": the mind tends to move from one passion to another passion that resembles it in feeling (e.g., from joy to love). Third, their "mutual assistance": if we feel a passion towards someÂ­thing, we will tend to feel a resembling passion towards something else natuÂ­rally related to it (e.g., from anger at one person to impatience at a related person). Applying all this to pride, Hume argues that the pleasant sensation of pride, directed at ourselves, naturally tends to be called up when something naturally related to ourselves produces a pleasant sensation of its own. LikeÂ­wise with humility: when something naturally related to ourselves produces an unpleasant sensation of its own, it tends to make us ashamed of ourselves. These indirect passions are thus the product of the "double relation of imÂ­pressions and ideas".
Hume completes his account with five "limitations". First, in order for pride or humility to be produced, the relation of ideas must be a relatively close one. Second, because our judgments are strongly influenced by "comparison", this relation must apply only to ourselves or a few others. Third, the cause of pride or humility must be something evident to ourselves and others. Fourth, this cause must be a long-lasting one. Fifth, general rules have a strong influence on our passions, leading us to overlook occasional anomalies.
Sections 7â€“10
In the next three sections, Hume puts his account to the test by examining three causes of pride and humility: the qualities of one's mind, of one's body, and of external objects. First, the qualities of the mind: our virtues and vices . Here Hume's main point is that, whatever the true nature of moral evaluation, whether it is a matter of innate moral psychology (Hume's own view), or inÂ­stead self-interest and cultural training (the view of Hobbes and Mandeville ), his account will hold up. For, on either theory, virtues produce a pleasant sensation of their own and vices a painful sensation of their own. Next come the qualities of the body: physical beauty and deformity . Here Hume's main point is that the beauty or deformity of something's structure is nothing more than its power to produce pleasure or pain in us. To the objection that though health and sickness produce pleasure and pain in us, they are not typÂ­ically sources of pride or humility, he recalls that these passions require a long-lastÂ­ing cause related only to ourselves or a few othersâ€”thus a long record of exÂ­ceptionally poor health can in fact be a source of shame. Finally, Hume exÂ­amÂ­ines the qualities of external objects related to us. Though the natural relation of reÂ­semblance has little influence, he explains, external objects do not cause pride or humility without some relation of contiguity or causationâ€”a fact he takes to confirm his overall account. After a few minor illustrations, Hume explains why pride in one's ancestors is magnified when the family enjoys unÂ­interÂ­rupted possession of land, and when it is passed down from male to male (both of the conditions, he claims, serve to strengthen the relation of ideas).
Hume devotes an entire section to "property and riches". His account easÂ­ily accommodates property : he defines it as private use consistent with the laws of justice, contends that (whether justice be a natural or artificial virtue) our minds naturally associate owners with their belongings, and observes that all things "useful, beautiful or surprizing" call up pride in their owner. But it is more difficult to accommodate riches : i.e., the mere power of acquiring the comforts of life. For Hume's earlier account of causation eliminated the disÂ­tinction between power and the exercise of power, as well as the very idea of an unexercised powerâ€”and how can I take pride in mere coins and paper without such an idea? Hume finds two ways for something like unexercised power to influence our passions: first, predictions of human behavior are (abÂ­sent "strong motives") plagued with uncertainty, and we can receive anticipaÂ­tory pleasure or unease from probable or merely possible exercise of power (tentatively reasoning from our own past conduct to guess what we might do); second, a "false sensation of liberty" presents all feasible courses of action as fully possible to us, giving us an anticipatory pleasure unrelated to any reasonÂ­ing from experience. Hume finishes by noting the pride we take in power over others, a pride enhanced by comparing our condition to theirs (thus humans are prouder to own other humans than to own sophisticated machinery).
Sections 11â€“12
Hume's next section adds a new kind of cause of pride and humility: viz., reputation , a "secondary cause" grounded in the enormously important mechanism of sympathy . For Hume, sympathy with others, or "communication", is that mechanism by which we naturally tend to receive and share in the passions and opinions of those we feel close to. We start by observing "external signs" (e.g., smiling or speaking) and forming an idea of another's sentiments. Since our extremely vivid conception of ourselves will tend to enliven any related idea, the closer the relation we see between ourselves and the other person, the more vivid our idea of their sentiments. And if this relation is close enough, we will end up actually feeling their passion or believing their opinÂ­ion: i.e., our idea of their passion or opinion will grow so lively as to become the very passion or opinion itself. This mirrors Hume's earlier account of causal reasoning: both processes move along the three natural relations, channeling the force and vivacity of vivid perceptions into faint ideas, enlivenÂ­ing them into much stronger perceptions.
Pride or shame in one's reputation, Hume continues, stems primarily from the sympathetically communicated opinions of others. But additional factors play a role: others might be seen as a good judge of character ("authority"), and the very question of one's self-worth is both emotionally heightened and apt to evoke a self-conscious deference to the opinions of others. The resultÂ­ing account explains various observations: why pride is affected more by the opinions of certain people (those whose character we like, whose judgment we respect, or who we have known for a long time), and less by opinions we know to be false (and thus cannot share in). Hume finishes by illustrating and conÂ­firming his account with a concrete example (viz., a man from a high-class family fallen on hard times leaving home to do manual labor elsewhere), and considering some minor objections.
In the final section, Hume seeks to confirm his overall account of pride and humility by applying it to animals. Following the model of anatomists, who test hypotheses by examining similar structures in humans and animals , Hume argues that animals can be observed to show pride and humility, that the causes are much the same (viz., pleasing qualities of the body), and that aniÂ­mals have the requisite psychological mechanisms (viz., the association of ideas, the association of impressions).
Part 2: Of love and hatred
Sections 1â€“3
Hume's treatment of love and hatred is much like his treatment of pride and humility: all four are indirect passions produced by a double relation of imÂ­pressions and ideas. As Part 2 begins, he again distinguishes object from cause, and quality from subject; whereas pride and humility were directed at oneself, love and hatred is directed at "some other person". As before, a relation of ideas is needed between the cause of love or hatred and the person loved or hated, and a relation of impressions between the cause (with a pleasant or unpleasant sensation of its own) and the resulting love or hatred. And since pride and love are closely connected (as Hume observes, we seek to win othÂ­ers' love by showcasing the qualities we take pride in), the arguments of Part 1 can simply be carried over.
In a series of eight "experiments", Hume tests his account against observaÂ­tions drawn from ordinary life. The first four experiments simply confirm that the four indirect passions arise only in response to something pleasant or unÂ­pleasant related to some person: utterly neutral objects (e.g., an ordinary stone) and objects related to no one (e.g., an unfamiliar environment) will never produce pride or humility, love or hatred. The final four experiments focus on how easily a transition is made from one passion to another. As Hume's account would predict, we easily go from love and hatred to pride and humility: e.g., I can take pride in my relation to someone else with lovable qualities. Curiously, however, the reverse does not hold: e.g., my pride in my own qualities will not lead me to love someone else for their relation to me. To explain this, Hume argues that the imagination has trouble going from lively ideas to obscure ideas (e.g., from the idea of oneself to that of another person). Next, as Hume's account would also predict, we easily transition from love of one person to love of others related to this person. But the transition is easiest when we "descend" from the greater to the lesser: e.g., "'tis more natuÂ­ral for us to love the son upon account of the father, than the father upon account of the son". And yet the imagination has the opposite tendency: e.g., moving easily from Jupiter's moons to Jupiter itself. To resolve this difficulty, Hume argues that it is easier for the passions to make minor changes (adding in the love of a related lesser person) than major changes (adding in the love of a related greater person), and that the passions "are a more powerful princiÂ­ple than the imagination". Finally, Hume acknowledges a case where we can move easily from pride to love: "when the very cause of the pride and humility is plac'd in some other person", e.g. when your praise of me excites my pride and I end up loving you for it. But this exception only confirms Hume's acÂ­count: since the first passion arises from the other person, we easily move to a passion directed at that same person.
Hume then confronts an objection: his account ignores intention, having us love or hate those who bring us pleasure or pain even where this is completely unintended . In response, Hume insists that qualities unrelated to intentional action really can elicit love or hatred, so long as the qualities are "constant and inherent in [someone's] person and character": e.g., disliking someone for their ugliness or stupidity. It is with isolated actions that intention is imÂ­portant: it "connect[s the action] with the person" and can also amplify the pleasantness or unpleasÂ­antness of the action, whereas "entirely involuntary and accidental" actions arouse only mild or short-lived passions. In a further illustration, Hume conÂ­siders our emotional reaction to those who harm us from perfectly justified motives (e.g., judges, competitors): though we will not hate them if we are reasonable, we often hate them anyway, even inventing reasons to hate them.
Sections 4â€“5
In the next two sections, Hume uses sympathy to account for some particular causes of love and hatred. First, "relation, acquaintance, and resemblance": we sometimes love others not for their personal qualities, but simply because they are related to us, familiar to us, or similar to us. In these cases, pleasure arises from the sheer stimulating effects of sympathy: family members, neighbors, and acquaintances are a durable source of lively ideas, as are individuals with personal qualities resembling our own. And as Hume puts it, "[e]very lively idea is agreeable, but especially that of a passion". He adds an explanation of why children feel far less related to mothers who remarry and yet only someÂ­what less related to fathers who remarryâ€”the imagination (which "finds a difÂ­ficulty in passing from greater to less") is more inclined to go from the mother to the mother's new family than from the father to the father's new family, a transition which weakens the original parent-child relation.
Second, we sometimes esteem people not for their personal qualities, but simply for being rich and powerful (esteem and contempt being "species of love and hatred"). To account for this phenomenon, Hume identifies three candidate "principles": (1) We enjoy thinking of their luxuries. (2) We think they might give us some of their wealth. (3) We sympathize with their happiÂ­ness. He then argues that the third principle, sympathy, is by far the most imÂ­portant. The first principle has some influence on its own, but mostly operates by means of sympathy. And the second principle has little influence: it is relatively rare to receive any personal advantage from the rich and powerful, and we esteem them even when this is known to be impossible. Hume closes the section with an overview of "the force of sympathy". Many animals, and espeÂ­cially humans, have a psychological need for social interaction. Moreover, sympathy with usefulness explains "[m]ost kinds of beauty": e.g., the convenÂ­ience of a house, the fertility of a field. Lastly, Hume observes that "the minds of men are mirrors to one another": a rich man enjoys his luxuries, which brings esteem from others, which in turn excites the rich man's pride, which encourages further pursuit of riches.
Sections 6â€“12
The next six sections are dedicated to an examination of the "compound pasÂ­sions", i.e. passions arising from "the mixture of love and hatred with other emotions". Hume begins with benevolence and anger , motivational "desires" aimed at bringing about "the happiness or misery of the person belov'd or hated". This marks an important contrast: love and hatred have innate motivaÂ­tional consequences, whereas pride and humility are only "pure emotions in the soul". But Hume goes on to note that benevolence and anger are (despite the talk of "mixture") not an "essential part" of love and hatred; instead, they are distinct passions of their own that only happen to be naturally conjoined with the sensations of love and hatred, just as hunger is naturally conjoined with an empty stomach.
Next come pity and malice . Like benevolence and anger, they are motivaÂ­tional desires aimed at bringing about another's happiness or misery; but unÂ­like benevolence and anger, they apply quite generallyâ€”not only to those we love or hate, but even to complete strangers. Thus Hume calls them "counterÂ­feited" versions of benevolence and anger. Pity (also called " compassion ") is received by sympathetic communication: anyone can arouse our pity, just by communicating "their interests, their passions, their pains and pleasures" to us. Even people who show no emotion at their misfortune can arouse our pity due to the influence of general rules on our imagination. Malicious joy is proÂ­duced by comparisonâ€”"[t]he misery of another gives us a more lively idea of our happiness, and his happiness of our misery"â€”and malice itself is "the unÂ­provok'd desire of producing evil to another, in order to reap a pleasure from the comparison" (though Hume adds a brief discussion of "malice against ourÂ­selves"). Hume also uses comparison to account for envy : the unpleasant feelÂ­ing we experience when another's "present enjoyment" makes our own happiÂ­ness seem diminished by comparison. He finishes the section by stressing the importance of a close relation of ideas: thus our envy tends to be confined to those in a similar line of work, a small horse seems more dwarfed by a large horse than by a mountain, and we gladly tolerate two adjacent paintings whose disparate styles would be "monstrous" if united in a single painting.
The following section sees Hume amending his account in response to a problem. If love and hatred are produced by anyone who brings us pleasure or pain, as Hume has argued, then we should love those who bring us malicious joy, and hate those who bring us the pain of pity. But this runs contrary to experience: we tend to hate the objects of our malice, and love the objects of our pity. Hume resolves this problem by introducing a new kind of relation of impressions: in addition to "the resemblance of sensations", there is also "the parallel direction of the desires". Thus the connection between pity and love, and between malice and hatred, lies in their motivational tendencies (which run parallel to each other), not in the way they feel (which run conÂ­trary to each other). Hume gives examples to illustrate and confirm this "prinÂ­ciple of a parallel direction", including a discussion of the emotions found in business rivals and business partners. But another problem arises: since Hume says we have esteem for the rich and contempt for the poor, how can he say we tend to love the objects of our pity? Hume's solution presents us with three levels of sympathy with misfortune: (1) weak sympathy, which makes us feel only the present misfortune of the afflicted, producing only contemptuous pity; (2) strong sympathy (i.e. "double sympathy"), which moves us beyond the present misfortune so that we take a motivating interest in their entire life, producing compassionate love; (3) all-consuming sympathy, which makes us fixate on the present misfortune, leaving us too " overcome with horror " to experience any other passions.
In the next section, Hume continues examining the compound passions, characterizing respect (also called "esteem") as a mixture of love and humility and contempt as a mixture of hatred and pride: the qualities of others proÂ­duce love or hatred immediately, pride or humility by comparison, and reÂ­spect or contempt when these are joined together. And because we have "a much stronger propensity to pride than to humility", there is more pride in contempt than there is humility in respect. Hume then acknowledges a probÂ­lem: why, given his account, aren't love and hatred always accompanied by respect and contempt? His answer is that, whereas "pride and hatred invigorÂ­ate the soul" and are associated with "magnificent" objects, "love and humility infeeble [the soul]" and are associated with "mean" objects: thus lovable obÂ­jects too mild to produce much pride (e.g., "good nature, good humour, facilÂ­ity, generosity, beauty") will produce "pure love, with but a small mixture of humility and respect". Hume finishes with an explanation of why social inferiÂ­ors are expected to keep their distance from their superiors.
The final compound passion is "the amorous passion", i.e. romantic love . It consists of three distinct passions: a sense of beauty , libido , and kindness . These three passions are bound together both by "resemblance" (all have a pleasant sensation) and by "a parallel desire" (all have related motivational tendencies). Accordingly, any one of them can end up producing the other two, with beauty most likely to produce the other two (kindness and libido being "too remote" from each other, and beauty "plac'd in a just medium beÂ­twixt them"). Hume argues that this phenomenon reinforces his "double relaÂ­tion of impressions and ideas" account.
Hume finishes Part 2 with his last section on animal psychology. Love and hatred, he writes, can be produced in animals simply by the pain or pleasure felt from an object, or by such relations as "acquaintance" and "likeness" of species. Sympathy works to spread feelings (e.g. fear, grief) from one animal to another, keep animal play from leading to injury, and animate a pack of hunting dogs beyond their individual level of excitement. In general, Hume remarks, the psychological mechanisms at work do not require any sophistiÂ­cated "force of reflection or penetration": "[e]very thing is conducted by springs and principles, which are not peculiar to man, or any one species of animals".
Part 3: Of the will and direct passions
Sections 1â€“2
In Part 3, Hume begins examining the motives that bring us to action. After a glancing mention of the direct passions and a perfunctory definition of the will as a mere impression we feel, he confronts the hoary philosophical probÂ­lem of free will and determinism , dedicating two sections to a defense of soft determinist compatibilism . In the first section, he makes a case for "the docÂ­trine of necessity". The issue, as Hume sees it, is whether human action is deÂ­termined by a necessity comparaÂ­ble to "physical necessity"â€”the necessity that governs physical objects. But since, according to Book 1, physical necessity is nothing more than constant conÂ­junction and the causal inferences drawn by the human mind, the issue then comes down to this: is there a regular correÂ­spondence between human action and human psychology, and do we base causal inferences upon such regulariÂ­ties? Hume thinks the answer to both questions is obviously in the affirmative: the uniformity found in the world of human affairs is comparable to that found in the natural world, and the inferÂ­ences we base on "moral evidence" (concerning human psychology and acÂ­tion) are comparable to the inferences we base on natural evidence (concernÂ­ing physical objects). Thus, given Hume's idiosyncratic account of necessity, it is hard to deny that human acÂ­tion is governed by necessity.
In the next section, Hume challenges "the doctrine of liberty"â€” the view that human beings are endowed with a distinctive kind of indeterministic free will â€”by setting out and debunking "the reasons for [its] prevalence". First, since we confuse necessity with violent constraint, we end up confusing freeÂ­dom from necessity (the indeterministic "liberty of indifference") with freedom from vioÂ­lent constraint (the compatibilist "liberty of spontaneity"). As a compatÂ­ibilist, Hume accepts the latter kind of free will, deeming it "that species of liberty, which it concerns us to preserve" and even "the most common sense of the word"; but he rejects freedom from necessity as either "absurd" (being nothing more than sheer "chance") or else "unintelligible". Second, we are deÂ­ceived by a "false sensation of liberty": when deliberating about our own acÂ­tions, there is "a certain looseness" to the will, so that we can easily produce an "image or faint motion" for each alternative course of action. Thus we end up convinced that we really could have acted differently, even though "a spectator can commonly infer our actions from our motives and character". Finally, we mistakenly think necessity poses a threat to moral responsibility, and is thereÂ­fore "dangerous... to religion and morality". After noting that being dangerous is not the same as being false, Hume recalls that his "necessity" is a very attenuÂ­ated one: there is nothing dangerous or even controversial about saying that constant conjunction and causal inference apply to human action as well as physical objects. He then attempts to turn the tables on his opponents, arguÂ­ing that necessity is in fact "essential" to moral responsibility : the rewards and punishments of human law would be pointless if human action were not reguÂ­lar and uniform, and divine punishment would be unjust if a person's actions were a matter of sheer chance, lacking any causal connection to the person's psychology, and revealing nothing about the person's character. Thus the threat to moral responsibility comes not from necessity, but from indeterministic liberty.
Sections 3â€“8
Hume then passes from the will itself to the motivational factors that deterÂ­mine voluntary actions. Against the traditional view that reason and the passions freÂ­quently come into motivational conflict , Hume argues that reason is incapable of opposing the passions, and that the passions cannot run contrary to reason. First, reason alone cannot motivate usâ€”it can only perform demonstrative or causal reasoning. And since abstract demonstrations influence us only by diÂ­recting causal reasoning (e.g., doing math to pay your debts), and causal reaÂ­soning influences us only by directing preexisting motives (e.g., figuring out how to make the food you want), reason itself cannot bring about any motivaÂ­tion. And this in turn means it cannot counteract or regulate the passions: on the contrary, "[r]eason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions". SeÂ­cond, passions cannot be in agreement or disagreement with reason: for this is a matter of the agreement or disagreement between an idea and the object it represents, and passions do not represent anything else. Thus Hume notoriÂ­ously writes: "'Tis not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger". Of course, if a passion is based on a false judgmentâ€”about an object that doesn't really exist, or a causal relation that doesn't really holdâ€”then the passion can be considered "unreasonable" in a less strict sense of the term. But "even then", insists Hume, "'tis not the pasÂ­sion, properly speaking, which is unreasonable, but the judgment". Finally, Hume argues that the alleged conflict between reason and the passions is acÂ­tually a conflict between two different kinds of passionsâ€”the calm passions and the violent passions. Since both the calm passions and reason "operat[e] with the same calmness and tranquility", we confuse them with each other and mistakenly suppose our calm passions to be "determinations of reason".
The following five sections examine the factors which give passions their motivational force. Unsurprisingly, the violence of a passion makes it stronger; but even a calm passion can be extremely strong due to "repeated custom and its own force", especially when it has been "corroborated by reflection, and seconded by resolution". Nevertheless, since "[g]enerally speaking, the violent passions have a more powerful influence on the will", Hume focuses on the factors which increase the violence of passions. First, when a "predominant passion" is accompanied by other "inferior" passions, it can acquire violence by "swallow[ing them] up": e.g., strong love can be made more violently pasÂ­sionate by a touch of anger. Other psychological phenomena (e.g., opposiÂ­tion, uncertainty, obscurity) can produce the same effect by stimulating us with agitation and mental effort. Next, "custom and repetition" can both leave us with a direct inclination to perform the activity we are repeating and also affect the violence of related passions. Hume discusses three stages of reÂ­peated activity : (1) The sheer novelty of unfamiliar activities makes our feelÂ­ings more intense, either magnifying our pain or adding on the pleasure of "wonder [and] surprize". (2) An activity performed with "moderate facility" is "an infallible source of pleasure" (cf. " flow "), sometimes even converting pain into enjoyment. (3) But excessive repetition can make formerly pleasant activÂ­ities so dull as to be unpleasant.
Our passions can also acquire violence from the vivacity of our ideas. Thus particular ideas make for more violent passions than general ideas, and so too for fresh memories, conventional ideas, and ideas enlivened by great eloÂ­quence or passionate delivery. And, as in Book 1, only beliefs (as opposed to "mere[s] fiction of the imagination") can call up any of our passions. Hume also devotes two sections to examining the vivacity of our ideas of space and time and the corresponding effect on our passions. In the first section, he acÂ­counts for three phenomena concerning vivacity and violence: (1) Distance in space and time is associated with a reduction in vivacity and violence (e.g., we care more about the near future than the distant future ), simply due to the number of mental steps needed to move from the present to the remote. (2) Distance in time is associated with a greater reduction than distance in space, because our sensory experience makes it easier to hold an array of spatial points in mind than an array of temporal points. (3) The distant past is associÂ­ated with a greater reduction than the distant future, because it is easier for the mind to go with the flow of time than to go against it. In the second secÂ­tion, he accounts for three very similar phenomena concerning "esteem and admiration": (1) Distance in space and time is associated with an increase in esteem and admiration (e.g., "a great traveller", "a Greek medal"), because the pleasure received from the sheer greatness of the "interpos'd distance" is transferred to the distant object itself. (2) Distance in time has a greater effect than distance in space (e.g., ancient relics are more admired than furniture from abroad), because we are challenged and invigorated by the greater diffiÂ­culty of mentally traversing distance in time. (3) The distant past has a greater effect than the distant future (e.g., we admire our ancestors more than our posterity), because we are challenged and invigorated by the greater difficulty of going against the flow of time . Hume finishes with a convenient summary of the preceding six sections.
Sections 9-10
At last Hume examines the direct passions, dividing them into two classes. First and most prominently, there are those direct passions which arise immediately from pleasure or pain (in Hume's terminology, " good or evil ")â€”this is simply due to "an original instinct " that orients us towards pleasure and away from pain. Joy and grief / sorrow arise from pleasure or pain that is "certain or probable". Hope and fear arise from pleasure or pain that is "uncertain" to some degree. Desire and aversion arise from pleasure and pain "consider'd simply". And the will "exerts itself" when pleasure or the absence of pain is within our power to obtain. Second, there are those direct passions which "arise from a natural impulse or instinct, which is perfectly unaccountable": here Hume mentions benevolence, anger, hunger , and lust (in section 3 he had mentioned self-preservation and the love of one's children ). These diverse instinct-based passions, Hume writes, "produce good and evil [i.e., pleasure and pain]", as opposed to the other direct passions, which arise from pleasure and pain.
Hume spends the rest of the section on hope and fear, starting with a simple account based on probability. In conditions of uncertainty, as the imagination fluctuates between a pleasant scenario and an unpleasant scenario, the passions follow suit, fluctuating between joy and grief. And since different passions can blend together (like the lingering notes of a string instrument ), the mixture of joy and grief will end up producing either hope or fear. But "contrary passions" interact differently depending on what they are directed at: the passions have no influence on each other if their objects are completely unrelated (e.g., joy at x, grief at y); the passions tend to cancel each other out if they have the same object (e.g., joy at x, but also grief at x); and the passions tend to blend together if they have "contradictory views of the same object" (e.g., joy at x, grief at not-x). Next, Hume tries to confirm and extend his account, noting that hope and fear can arise from "all kinds of uncertainty": thus fear can be produced by the mere thought of a possible evil if it is great enough, the immediate presence of a potential evil known to be impossible, the certainty of an evil too horrible to think about or whose precise nature is unknown, or anything extremely surprising . Even utterly irrelevant circumstances, or something expected to be pleasant, can call up fear if shrouded in uncertainty. Hume closes the section by begging off any discussion of subtle "variations" of hope and fear, or of the role of the will and the direct passions in animals.
Book 2 finishes with a brief section on curiosity â€”"the love of truth ", which leads us to take pleasure in intellectual pursuits and achievements. For both the abstract truths of "mathematics and algebra" and the real-world truths of "morals, politics, natural philosophy", we do not care much about truth "merely as such". Instead, there are three other factors chiefly responsible for "the pleasure of study": (1) Intellectual challenge: the exercise must force us to "fix our attention and exert our genius". (2) Importance/utility: the topic must be useful or important enough to "fix our attention" via "a remote sympathy" with those our work might help (a sympathy that even motivates scholars lacking in "public spirit"). (3) Direct concern: just as hunters and gamblers begin to care about success itself more than the reward it brings, likewise scholars begin to develop a direct concern for the scholarly problems they work on (this due to the aforementioned principle of a "parallel direction"). Finally, Hume offers an account of the social curiosity that fuels gossip : since doubt and uncertainty are painful, especially when they concern events whose ideas are forceful, we are naturally curious about the happenings of our immediate social environment.
Book 3: Of Morals
Part 1: Of virtue and vice in general
Hume begins Book 3 by examining the nature of moral evaluation, offering a critique of moral rationalism and a defense of moral sentimentalism: in the terms of his overall system, Hume is arguing that the evaluations in our mind are impressions, not ideas. His main target is the rationalism of such philosoÂ­phers as Clarke and Balguy , which posits "eternal fitnesses and unfitnesses of things, which are the same to every rational being that considers them", in effect classifying morality alongside mathematics under "relations of ideas". Hume's principal arguments against this rationalism rest on Book 2's thesis that there is no opposition between reason and the passions: reason alone cannot motivate us, and "passions, volitions, and acÂ­tions" cannot be in agreeÂ­ment or disagreement with reason. This thesis "proves directly", he writes, that an action's moral status cannot consist in the action's agreement or disaÂ­greeÂ­ment with reason, and it "proves indirectly" that moral evaluation, which has a practical influence on us and can "excite passion[s] and produce or preÂ­vent actions", cannot be "the offspring of reason". Nor can the morality of an acÂ­tion be founded on the true or false judgments causally linked to it: no imÂ­moral action is wrong due to its arising from a mistake of fact, or (contra WolÂ­laston ) due to its causing false judgments in othÂ­ers.
After summing up this critique, Hume develops a "more particular" case against rationalism, recalling his system's two kinds of reasoning: "the comparÂ­ing of ideas" and "the inferring of matter of fact". Now as for demonstrative reasoning, the four abstract relations from Book 1 seem perfectly irrelÂ­evant to morality, and indeed it is hard to see how any relation could have just the right scope (holding only between someone's psychology and external situaÂ­tion) and the right practical implications as well (somehow it must be certain a priori that no rational being could consider these relations without being motivated accordÂ­ingly). Consider the immorality of parricide and incest : this cannot consist merely in the abstract relations at play, for the very same relations can be found in perfectly non-moral contexts involving inanimate objects and anÂ­iÂ­mals. And as for probable reasoning, Hume famously contends that we obÂ­serve nothing in an action besides its ordinary non-moral qualitiesâ€”experience reveals no moral qualities unless one looks to the moral feelings in one's own mind, so that virtue and vice are (like the secondary qualities of modern phiÂ­losophy) "not qualities in objects, but perceptions in the mind". This first secÂ­tion ends with the famous is-ought paragraph.
Hume is thus left endorsing a moral sentimentalism somewhat like that of Hutcheson : "Morality... is more properly felt than judg'd of". The moral evaluÂ­ations in our mind are impressionsâ€”"nothing but particular pains or pleasÂ­ures"â€”and Hume's task is to explain how certain kinds of "action, or sentiÂ­ment, or character" produce these special moral sentiments in us. But a probÂ­lem arises: since pleasant or painful feelings can be produced by inanimate obÂ­jects, why doesn't sentimentalism succumb to the same objection Hume has just raised against rationalism? First, he contends there are many different kinds of pleasure and pain, and that the moral sentiments (which arise "only when a character is consider'd in general, without reference to our particular interest") have a distinctive feeling, noticeably different than the feelings called up by inanimate objects (or matters of self-interest). Second, he reÂ­minds us that the four indirect passions are produced by pleasant or unpleasÂ­ant qualities in ourselves or other persons, not inanimate objects. This objection dispatched, Hume closes with two points about the psychological origin of moral sentiments. First, on the working assumption that nature tends to proÂ­duce variety from "a few prinÂ­ciples", he hopes to find "general principles" unÂ­derlying our moral psycholÂ­ogy. Second, to the question of whether these prinÂ­ciples are "natural", he reÂ­plies that it depends on the meaning of "natural": they are not miraculous, nor are they rare, but they might sometimes draw on human artifice (his system will include both natural virtues and artificial virÂ­tues), adding that none of these meanings can sustain the popular view (deÂ­fended by Butler) that "virtue is the same with what is natural, and vice with what is unnatural". Before proceeding to his detailed examination of moral psychology, Hume takes a parting shot at moral rationalism and its "incomprehensible relations and qualities, which never did exist in nature, nor even in our imagination, by any clear and disÂ­tinct conception".
Part 2: Of justice and injustice
Sections 1â€“2
Hume devotes Part 2 to the "artificial virtues": those positive character traits that would have no moral appeal were it not for social conventions established by human artifice . The most important of these virtues is justice , and in the first section Hume offers his so-called "circle argument" to show that justice would not be seen as a virtue in a hypothetical world lacking the relevant soÂ­cial conventions. First, Hume conÂ­tends, character-based motives are morally more fundamenÂ­tal than actions : we approve of an action only insofar as it indiÂ­cates some virtuÂ­ous motive in the agent's character, so that what makes an action virtuous in the first place is the virtuous motive it proceeds from. But this moÂ­tive must be an ordinary motive in human nature, as opposed to the distincÂ­tive moral moÂ­tive of performing the action because it is virtuous (i.e., a "sense of duty"). After all, this moral motive presupÂ­poses that the action alÂ­ready counts as virtuous, and it would be circular to derive the action's virtue from a motive which itself presupposes the action's virtue. And so if justice were a natural virtue, there would have to be an ordinary moÂ­tive in human nature that could make someone obey the rules of justice. But according to Hume, no such motive can be found: unbridled self-interest leads us away from justice, conÂ­cern for reputation only goes so far, impartial public benevolence cannot explain all cases of justice and is not even a true element of human nature (contra HutÂ­cheson, we love others only in a limited and disÂ­criminating way), and private benevolence for our nearest and dearest cannot explain the universal and imÂ­partial nature of justice. Thus there is no motive capable of making justice count as a virtue, not until cerÂ­tain social conventions come into place. Hume closes this section by adding that we evaluate motives largely by comÂ­parison with what we consider to be normal human psychology, and that the rules of justice are so "obvious" and "necesÂ­sary" an invention that they can still be deemed "natural" to the human speÂ­cies.
Hume next devotes an important and lengthy section to two questions: First, how is the social convention of justice established? And second, why do we invest the rules of justice with moral significance? His answer to the first quesÂ­tion begins with our need for society . Humans are not strong, skilled, or seÂ­cure enough to meet our needs alone, and only society can offer additional labor force, specialization , and mutual aidâ€”all important advantages of sociÂ­ety learned of through growing up in families . But this necessary social union is threatened both by human selfishness (or rather "confin'd generosity") and by the scarcity and instability of external goods . And since our uncultivated natÂ­ural affections cannot overcome these obstacles (we see nothing wrong with having a norÂ­mal amount of selfishness and generosity), it is left to our reason and self-interest to find a solution: through "a general sense of common interÂ­est" that is "muÂ­tually expressed" and known to everybody, we gradually deÂ­velop a social conÂ­vention for the stabilizing and safeguarding of external goods, with improved compliance and stronger social expectations feeding into each other, a process Hume compares to the development of languages and currency . He insists that this convention is not a promise , famously illustratÂ­ing the point with the example of two men agreeing to row a boat together, simply from a sense of mutual advantage rather than from any promise. And as justice is defined in terms of such a convention, so too the related concepts of "property, or right, or obligation" can mean nothing in its absence.
Since the chief obstacle to society (our selfishness, especially our insatiaÂ­ble acquisitiveÂ­ness ) is in fact the very motive responsible for society, the growth of social order depends less on our moral qualities than on our intelÂ­lectual qualities. But since stabilizing exÂ­ternal goods is such a "simÂ­ple and obÂ­vious" rule, the convention is established with little delay, so that "the state of nature " is a "mere philosophiÂ­cal ficÂ­tion"â€”not very realistic but useful for theoÂ­rizing. SimiÂ­larly edifying, "the golden age " (a fictional time of superabundant reÂ­sources and univerÂ­sal brotherly love) helps shed light on the origins of justice: were it not for certain non-ideal circumstances (selfÂ­ishness, limited generosity, resource scarcity, resource instability), the rules of justice would be pointless. Real-world cases also illustrate the idea: close personal relationships bring one's priÂ­vate belongings into common ownership, and free goods like air and water are allowed unrestricted use. And this general point, Hume says, reinÂ­forces three earlier points: (1) Public benevolence cannot be why we obey the rules of justice, for it would only make these rules pointless. (2) Moral raÂ­tionÂ­alism cannot make sense of justice: mere abÂ­stract reasoning can neither acÂ­count for the fact that justice hinges on specific background condiÂ­tions, nor produce the conÂ­cern for our interests that originally leads us to establish the rules of justice. (3) Justice is an artificial virtue: though the whole purpose of justice is to serve our interÂ­ests, the conÂ­nection between jusÂ­tice and our interÂ­ests disÂ­solves in the absence of the releÂ­vant social convenÂ­tion. For without this conÂ­vention, wholehearted pursuit of the public interest would make justice pointless and unrestrained purÂ­suit of private interests would leave justice in ruÂ­ins. And likewise, without this convention, cerÂ­tain individual acts of justice (e.g., reÂ­turning money to a vilÂ­lain) would run contrary to our private interests and even the public interÂ­est: such unfortunate acts are worth performing only beÂ­cause of our convenÂ­tion-based expectation that others will follow our exÂ­ample and reinforce the "whole system", which does serve everyone's adÂ­vantage.
Hume's answer to the second question is that our approval of justice and disapproval of injustice is based in sympathy with the public interest. Justice was established to serve our interests, but when society grows large enough, we might lose sight of how injustice threatens social order. Fortunately, the threat can be made vivid again when I myself am the victim of injustice, or when I imparÂ­tially sympathize with others threatened by injustice. Their sympathetiÂ­cally communicated negative feelings form the basis of my disapproval of inÂ­justice, and this evaluation subsequently extends to my own behavior through the inÂ­fluence of general rules and sympathy with the opinÂ­ions of others. Three addiÂ­tional factors then reinforce these moral sentiments: (1) Public leaders propÂ­agandize on behalf of justice (contra Mandeville, this technique works only by appealing to and intensifying moral sentiments we already have). (2) Parents instill children with a reliable and deeply-rooted concern for the rules of jusÂ­tice. (3) Concern for reputation makes us scrupulously avoid inÂ­justice as a matter of personal principle.
Sections 3â€“6
The next four sections see Hume completing his examination of justice as an artificial virtue: he argues that "the three fundamental laws of nature , that of the stability of possession, of its transference by consent, and of the performance of promÂ­ises" are all based on human convention. He begins by discussing the general rule of stability and its applications. To make a peaceful establishment of sociÂ­ety, we must avoid controversial "particular judgments" about who is best suited to make use of what resources, and instead adopt a general rule of preÂ­sent possesÂ­sion, simply as a "natural expedient" with all the appeal of custom. Once sociÂ­ety has been established, the additional rules of occupation (i.e. " first possesÂ­sion "), prescription (i.e. " long possession "), accession (e.g. "the fruits of our garÂ­den"), and succession (i.e. inheritance ) are developed. These rules are largely the product of the imagination, with ownership determined by the asÂ­sociation of ideas. Second, because "rigid stability" would of course bring great disadÂ­vantages (resources having been allocated by mere "chance"), we need a peaceÂ­ful way to induce changes in ownership: thus we adopt the "obvious" rule of transference by conÂ­sent . And as for the related rule of "delivery" (physically transÂ­ferring the object or some symbolic token thereÂ­of), this is simply a useful technique for visualizÂ­ing "the mysterious tranÂ­sition of the property" (property being an inconceivaÂ­ble qualÂ­ity "when taken for someÂ­thing real, without any reference to morality, or the sentiments of the mind"), much as Catholics use imagery to "represent the inconceivable mysÂ­teries of the Christian religion".
Hume then examines the final "law of nature"â€”the performance of promisesâ€”giving a two-stage argument that promise-keeping is an artificial virtue. First, promises are naturally unintelligible, for there is no distinctive mental act for promises to express, neither resolutions nor desires nor a direct willing of the act. And as for willing an obligation, this is too absurd to be plausible: given that changes in obligation require changes in human sentiment, it is plainly imposÂ­sible to will an obligation into existence. But second, even if promises were naturally intelligible, they could not create an obligation: i.e., even if we were foolish enough to mentally will an obligation, nothing would change, since no voluntary act could ever change human sentiments. Hume also reprises the circle argument, arguing that there is no motive for promise-keeping other than a sense of duty in doing so.
How, then, does the artificial convention of promising come about? The first two laws of nature, for all their usefulness, leave many further opportuniÂ­ties for mutual advantage unrealized (e.g., non-simultaneous cooperative exÂ­changes of labor ), unable to overcome the meanness of human nature in the absence of "mutual confidence and security". But unvirtuous individuals will soon learn to cooperate with each other simply from a self-interested expectaÂ­tion of the benefits of future cooperation, and special language is introduced to express one's resolution to perform one's part (on penalty of social disÂ­trust)â€”thus the practice is distinguished from the favors of true friends, and secured through staking one's reputation on faithful performance. The conÂ­vention is then made moral in the same way as before ("[p]ublic interest, educaÂ­tion, and the artiÂ­fices of politicians") and a fictional act of the mind ("willing an obligation") is fabricated to make sense of the moral obligation. Finally, Hume reinforces this explanation by observing that a promise obligates you even if you mentally crossed your fingers , but does not obligate you if it was honestly unintended or if you were obviously joking, and yet does obligate you if your devious insincerÂ­ity is apparent to shrewd observers, and yet does not obligate you if induced by force (alone among all motives): "[a]ll these contradicÂ­tions", Hume says, are best explained by his convention-based account of promising. He adds that the "terrible" Catholic doctrine of intention (viz., that a sacrament is invaliÂ­dated if its minister is in the wrong state of mind ) is actuÂ­ally more reasonable than the practice of promisingâ€”since theology is less important than promise-keeping, it can afford to sacrifice utility to conÂ­sistency.
Finally, Hume reviews these "laws of nature" and offers three additional arguÂ­ments for their artificiality. (1) Justice is commonly defined in terms of property, and yet it is impossible to understand property except in terms of justice. But since there is no natural sentiment of approval for the practice of justice described in neutral language, "abstracting from the notio[n] of propÂ­erty" (e.g., restoring an object to its first possessor), justice is not a natural virÂ­tue. (2) Justice and injustice come in bright lines and sharp boundaries , whereas our natural moral sentiments come in degrees. (3) Justice and injusÂ­tice are universal and general, whereas our natural moral sentiments are parÂ­tial and particular: e.g., justice might decide in favor of a featherbrained and filthy-rich bachelor instead of a level-headed man trying to support his destiÂ­tute family, setting aside as irrelevant all the circumstances that engage our affections in favor of the latter.
Sections 7â€“12
In the next six sections, Hume completes his "system concerning the laws of nature and nations" with a lengthy discussion of government . The need for govÂ­ernment arises from our short-term thinking: though lawful conduct is clearly in our interest, we get carried away by a dangerous "narrowness of soul, which makes [us] prefer the present to the remote", so that rule violations become more frequent and therefore more strategically advisable. Humans are incaÂ­pable of overcoming this weakness and changing our nature, no matter how much we may regret it from a clear-sighted long-term perspective, so we must instead change our situation and turn to the artificial expedient of governÂ­ment: giving fairly disinterested public officials the power to enforce the laws of justice, to decide disputes impartially, and even to provide public goods otherwise underproduced due to free rider problems .
Hume then critiques the liberal Whig theory of government as deriving its authority only from the consent of the governed , as traced back to an original contract between ruler and people. He agrees with the rudiments of the Whig theory: simple societies can long subsist without government, for it is war beÂ­tween societies that first brings serious social disorder (from conflict over the spoils of war ) and then government, with military leaders becoming political leaders at a public assembly. But though government typically originates in a social agreement, promising cannot be its one and only source of authority. For, as Hume has argued, promise-keeping itself originates in a social convenÂ­tion serving the public interest, so that if government serves the public interest by "preserv[ing] order and concord in society", then it gains an authority of its own equivalent to that of promise-keeping. We have a parallel interest in both: promise-keeping is a human invention needed for social cooperation, and government is a human invention needed (in large and advanced societies) for reliably enforcing such practices and thereby preserving social order, with neither invention serving a more general or more significant interest than the other. And the two run parallel morally as well: promise-breaking and anti-govÂ­ernment action are both disapproved of primarily from a sense of common interest. Thus there is no sense founding the one in the other. Hume also apÂ­peals to the opinions of everyday people (which in questions of morality and other sentimentalist domains "carry with them a peculiar authority, and are, in a great measure, infallible"), who see themselves as born to obedience indeÂ­pendently of any promising, tacit or otherwise, even to authoritarian statesâ€”an understanding reflected in legal codes on rebellion .
But Hume agrees with the Whigs about the right of resistance when governÂ­ments become tyrannical. Our interest in government consists in "the security and protection, which we enjoy in political society", and therefore disappears as soon as the authorities become intolerably oppressive. And though our moral obligation to allegiance might be expected to linger on stubbornly due to the influence of general rules, our familiarity with human nature and the history of tyrants will give us additional general rules marking out exceptions to the common rule. And thus public opinion ("perfectly infallible" in quesÂ­tions of morality) is not wed to any exceptionless rule of " passive obedience ", but is perfectly willing to "make allowances for resistance in the more flagrant instances of tyranny and oppression".
The next problem of allegiance is who exactly is the rightful ruler? And accordÂ­ing to Hume, such questions are often irresolvable by reason, and it can be wise to simply go with the flow in the "interests of peace and liberty". Again, Hume agrees that political society begins with a social agreement promising alleÂ­giance to certain people. But once a government acquires its own authority by serving the public interest, it is (paradoxically) in our interest to renounce our interest and simply abide the powers that be, lest we fall into divisive conÂ­troverÂ­sies over the best possible ruler. Questions of succession are then anÂ­swered with five somewhat arbitrary principles: (1) long possession: the influÂ­ence of custom favors long-established forms of governments, though it takes longer to acÂ­quire a right to large nations; (2) present possession: few governÂ­ments have any better claim to authority than successfully holding onto power; (3) conquest : we favor glorious conquerors over detestable usurpers ; (4) succesÂ­sion : along with the clear advantages of hereditary government, Hume emphaÂ­sizes our imagiÂ­native tendency to associate parents with children and pass belongings from one to the other; (5) positive laws: lawmakers may change the form of governÂ­ment, though any drastic departures from tradition are apt to diminÂ­ish popuÂ­lar allegiance. And with so many distinct principles, the choice of ruler is sometimes wonderfully clear, and sometimes hopelessly unclear. In a closing discussion of the Glorious Revolution, Hume defends keeping the right of resistance unformulated and out of the legal code, and extending this right from cases of direct oppression to cases of interbranch constitutional enÂ­croachment in "mix'd governments" , adding two "philosophical reflections": first, Parliament's authority to exclude the heirs of rulers they have deposed, but not the heirs of rulers who simply died, derives from mere imaginative inertia; second, a contested change in authority may acquire legitimacy retroÂ­actively from a stable line of successors.
Hume then examines international law : the similarities between individuals and entire nations yield the same three laws of nature as before, but the speÂ­cial needs of nations call for special rules (e.g., diplomatic immunity ). But because cooperation among nations is "not so necessary nor advantageous as that among individuals", moral rules have significantly less force in internaÂ­tional contexts and "may lawfully be transgress'd from a more trivial motive"â€”i.e., a weaker natural obligation brings a weaker moral obligation. Only genÂ­eral practice can determine exactly how much weaker the obligation is, and indeed the fact that the rules are recognized to be weaker in practice shows that people have "an implicit notion" of their artificiality.
The final section examines the social rules governing the sexual behavior of women (" chastity and modesty "), which Hume takes to nicely illustrate how artificial virtues grounded only in social interest can nevertheless acquire uniÂ­versal force. It is boringly obvious that these rules are not exactly natural, and yet they solve a natural problem: a child needs both parents, parÂ­ents need to know the child is theirs, and paternity is subject to uncertainty. And since questions of sexual fidelity cannot be settled in courtrooms, society needs inÂ­formal norms (with weakened evidential standards and heightened reputaÂ­tional import) policing fidelity in women. Indeed, Hume adds, given female weakÂ­ness in the face of sexual temptation , society needs women to feel a strong aversion to anything even suggestive of infidelity. This solution might sound unrealistic in the abstract, but nature has made it a reality: those perÂ­sonally concerned with infidelity have swept along the unconcerned in their disapÂ­proval, molded the minds of girls, and extended the general rule into apparently irrational territory , with "debauch'd" men shocked at any female transÂ­gression and postmenopausal women condemned for perfectly harmless promiscuity . Men instead stake their reputation on courage (a partly natural virtue) and enjoy looser sexual norms, fidelity in males (like cooperation among nations) being less important for society.
Part 3: Of the other virtues and vices
Section 1
Hume finishes the Treatise by examining the "natural virtues": those character traits approved of independently of social conventions. In a general review of morality and the passions, he reminds us that human psychology is driven by pain and pleasure, which call up direct passions and then the indirect passions that explain moral evaluation and which "qualities or characters" count as virÂ­tuous or not. And since the indirect passions apply to actions only as indicatÂ­ing something stable in the agent's mind, the moral sentiments are also diÂ­rected primarily at "mental qualities" and only derivatively at actions.
After this review, Hume presents his central "hypothesis" concerning the natural virtues and vices: moral evaluation of these traits is best explained in terms of sympaÂ­thy. The hypothesis is supported by three points: sympathy is so "very powerÂ­ful" that mere observation of an emotion's causes or effects can communicate the emotion to us, the beauty we find in anything useful stems from sympathy with the pleasure it might bring its users, and likewise the moral beauty we find in the artificial virtues stems from sympathy with the public interest that these virtues serve. Given these three points, and given that natural virtues and social utility often go together, parsimony dictates that we also explain the natural virtues in terms of sympathy. Hume finds the conÂ­nection between virÂ­tue and utility fairly obvious: it inspired Mandeville's erroÂ­neous account of virtue as a fraudulent invention of conniving politicians, and indeed the conÂ­nection is even stronger with natural virtues than with artificial virtues. For though artificial virtues may harm society in particular cases (promoting the public interest only when mediated by a "general scheme"), natural virtues help society in every case, which makes it even more probable that sympathy explains moral evaluation of the natural virtues.
Hume further develops his sympathy-based account of the natural virtues by considering two objections. First, variability and impartiality: how can someÂ­thing as variable as sympathy account for moral impartiality of the sort that recognizes virtue in loved ones and complete strangers alike? Hume's answer is that, because variability in moral evaluation would lead to hopeless practical conflict, we correct ourÂ­selves in our "general judgments" by fixing onto a "common point of view": i.e., we focus on the people within someone's sphere of influence, and evaluÂ­ate his character by sympathetically considering how they are affected by his character traits. Indeed, we perform similar correcÂ­tions for our senses and our aesthetic judgments. Of course, our passions may resist correction, so that only our language is changed; but we still know that our emotional favoritism of some over others would go away if we were equally close to them all, which is perhaps enough to settle "a general calm determiÂ­nation of the passions". SeÂ­cond, moral luck : how can sympathy explain cases where unusual external circumstances have prevented someone's internal character from having its usual effects? Hume's answer is that the imagination folÂ­lows general rules, focusing more on something's general tendencies than its actual effects, and that our moral sentiments are influenced accordingly. NatÂ­urally, we will feel even stronger approval when the general tendency is actuÂ­ally realized, but we deÂ­liberately set aside moral luck to correct our general moral judgments. This explains how we can manage such "extensive sympaÂ­thy" in morality deÂ­spite our "limited generosity" in practice: it takes "real conseÂ­quences" and particÂ­ular cases to "touch the heart" and "controul our passions", but "seeming tendencies" and general trends are enough to "influence our taste".
He finishes this general treatment of the natural virtues with a fourfold classifiÂ­cation: every natural virtue is either (1) useful to others, (2) useful to the person himself, (3) immediately agreeable to others, or (4) immediately agreeable to the person himself. Of these "four sources of moral distinctions", the most important are the virtues of usefulness , which please us even when mere private interest is at stake: thus we approve of prudence and frugality, and while the vice of "indolence" is sometimes indulged (as an excuse for the unÂ­successful or a veiled boast of sophistication), "dexterity in business" wins apÂ­proval by sheer sympathy with the person's private interest. The two categoÂ­ries of useful virtues are often blended together by sympathy: what hurts me ends up paining others as they sympathize with me, and what hurts others ends up paining me as I sympathize with them. Less important are the virtues of immediate agreeableness: instead of reflecting on the positive tendencies of a mental quality, we simply find it pleasant in and of itself (e.g. wit, insouciÂ­ance). And even here sympathy plays a major role: we approve of these virtues in large part because they bring pleasure to others or the person himself. Hume concludes with "a general review of the present hypothesis"â€”viz., that we evaluate character by sympathetically considering its impact on the person himself and others within his sphere of influenceâ€”and a brief remark on how " good or ill desert " is explained in terms of the benevolence or anger that come with evaluating (i.e. loving or hating) another person.
Section 2â€“3
Hume then applies his "general system of morals" to two kinds of virtue: the rough " heroic virtue " of the great, and the kind-hearted virtue of the good. As for heroic virtue, it derives its merit from a suspect source: pride. Pride has a bad name because the idea of someone superior to us can be so immediately disagreeable, but Hume distinguishes between "ill-grounded" and "well-grounded" pride. Ill-grounded pride pains us by compariÂ­son, when someÂ­one else overrates their own merit and this idea of a superior becomes more than an "idle" fiction and reaches a medium level of strength. But someone else's well-grounded pride brings us pleasure by sympathy, when the idea is so strong in us that we fully believe in their merit. And thus well-grounded pride is a virtue, thanks to its usefulness and agreeableness to the person himself. Now, beÂ­cause we are so prone to the vice of excessive pride, social harmony deÂ­mands artificial rules (" rules of good-breeding ") against the open expression of any pride at all. But "a man of honour" is still expected to have a healthy inÂ­ternal sense of his own merit, and those whose modesty goes too far are scorned for their "meanness" or "simÂ­plicity". Thus it is that heroic virÂ­tuesâ€”"[c]ourage, intrepidÂ­ity, ambition, love of glory , magnanimity , and all the other shining virtues of that kind"â€”are chiefly admired for the "well-reguÂ­lated pride" they embody. Indeed, though excessive pride is harmful to oneÂ­self (even when courteously concealed from others), and military glory is ofÂ­ten extremely harmful to others, nevertheless there is someÂ­thing admirable and "dazzling" in the pride of a hero, due to the immediately agreeable "eleÂ­vated and sublime sensation" he experiÂ­ences. Hume adds that our disapproval of open pride even in those who have never inÂ­sulted us (e.g. historical figures) is due to an additional sympathy with the people around them.
As for the virtues of "goodness and benevolence", Hume explains their merit primarily in terms of their positive impact on others. The section begins by reviewing Hume's account of moral evaluation from the common point of view, and of sympathy with a person's sphere of influence. Here the "tender pasÂ­sions" are not only themselves good for society, they are needed to direct other virtues towards the public good. But there is also a more immeÂ­diate apÂ­proval, as we are simply "touch'd with a tender sentiment" or sympaÂ­thetic to characters like our ownâ€”this is why even benevolent "trifles" and excesses in love still win approval, as the love in their minds easily converts into love in our minds for them. As for the contrasting "angry passions", they are judged by comparison with humanity in generalâ€”such passions are excused when normal, sometimes scorned when absent, and even applauded when impressively low, though "they form the most detested of all vices" when they "rise up to cruelty "â€”and for its negative impact on others. Indeed, in general, your moral virtue is mostly determined by how desirable you are in different social relations.
Sections 4â€“5
Hume finishes by explaining how his system accommodates not only the "moral virtues" but also the "natural abilities" of the mind, and by downplayÂ­ing the distinction as not very important and largely a matter of mere terminolÂ­ogy. Virtues and abilities are alike, Hume contends, in their "causes and efÂ­fects": they are mental qualities that produce pleasure and elicit apÂ­proval, and we all care about both. To the objection that the distinction matÂ­ters because the approval of abilities feels different from the approval of virÂ­tues, Hume reÂ­sponds that our approval of different things always feels differÂ­ent (e.g., with different virtues). To the objection that virtues are unlike abiliÂ­ties in being voluntary and involving free will, Hume replies that many virtues are involunÂ­tary (especially the virtues of the great), that voluntariness has no clear releÂ­vance to the process of moral evaluation, and that we have no free will other than mere voluntariness. But voluntariness helps explain why "morÂ­alists" think the distinction matters: in contexts of moral exhortation, Hume explains, it is important to focus on those qualities that are most responsive to social presÂ­sure, rather than approving indiscriminately of any mental excelÂ­lence, like everyday people and ancient philosophers.
These natural abilities of the mind are valued mainly for their usefulness for the person himself: e.g. prudence , sagacity , industry , patience . Sometimes immediate agreeableness is most important, whether to others (e.g. wit , eloquence , charisma , even cleanliness ) or the person himself (e.g. cheerfulness). And our judgments are influenced by empirical associations between a quality and a person's age or walk of life (e.g., disapproving of levity in the old ). The puzzle of why we don't evaluate people for having a fine or poor memory Hume resolves by noting that (unlike the intellect) "the memory is exerted without any sensation of pleasure or pain; and in all its middling degrees serves almost equally well in business and affairs". And natural abilities also influence our evaluations due to making an able person far more consequential in life (for good or for bad).
Though thus far his account has dealt exclusively with mental qualities, Hume even goes some way to accommodate "bodily advantages" and "the advantages of fortune ", which are equally capable of eliciting "love and approbation". Thus women love a strong man by sympathy with the utility his lover receives, we all find beauty in healthy and useful body parts, and there is an immediate pleasure or pain from regular features or "a sickly air". And thus we esteem the wealthy by symÂ­pathy with the pleasure their riches give them, reinforced by their being more consequential. Hume closes by noting that, though he cannot explain why, the feeling of approval is more determined by the kind of the object evaluated (e.g. inanimate objects, people) than by the kind of mechanism driving the approval (e.g. sympathy with utility, immediate agreeableness).
Section 6
The conclusion of Book 3, and therefore the Treatise as a whole, briefly recaÂ­pitulates the reasoning for Hume's thesis that "sympathy is the chief source of moral distinctions". Indeed, most would agree that justice and "the useful qualities of the mind" are valued for their usefulness, and what besides sympaÂ­thy can explain why we care about the public good or "the happiness of strangers"? This "system of ethics" is not only supported by "solid arguÂ­ment", Hume adds, but it can help moralists show the "dignity" and the "happiÂ­ness" of virtue. First, it puts morality in a good light to see it derived from "so noble a source" as sympathy: we end up approving of virtue, the sense of virtue, and even the psychological principles underlying the sense of virtue. And while the artificiality of justice may seem unattractive at first, this disappears when we remember that since "[t]he interest, on which justice is founded, is the greatÂ­est imaginable, and extends to all times and place", therefore the rules of jusÂ­tice are "stedfast and immutable; at least, as immutable as human nature". Secondly, a life of virtue pays off quite well, bringing immediate adÂ­vantages, an enhanced social reputation, and the "inward satisfaction" of a mind able to " bear its own survey ". So, while Hume presents himself as a theoretical "anatoÂ­mist" who disÂ­sects human psychology into ugly bits, his work is well-suited for the practical "painter" who styles morality into a beautiful and inviting ideal.
