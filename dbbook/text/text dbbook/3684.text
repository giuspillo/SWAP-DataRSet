World Without End is a six-issue American comic book limited series, created by Jamie Delano and illustrated by John Higgins, released by DC Comics in 1990. Delano has said: “ After four years of Hellblazer, WWE felt like an opportunity to cut lose into a world of outrageous language and sumptuous imagery… and no-one held us back. The scenario of the story is fantastical and allegorical rather than speculatively futuristic. I guess its themes are more broadly philosophical than some of the specific socio/political trends I have engaged with through the more near-future settings of works such as 2020 VISIONS, HELLBLAZER: BAD BLOOD and NARCOPOLIS, etc.. ”
