Where the Sidewalk Ends (1974) is a collection of children's poetry written and illustrated by Shel Silverstein and published by Harper and Row Publishers. The book's poems address many common childhood concerns and also presents purely fanciful stories. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named the book one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children. " A 30th Anniversary Edition of the book appeared in 2004, and two audio editions (1983 and 2000) are also available.
