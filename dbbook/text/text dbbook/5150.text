The Flanders Panel (original Spanish title La tabla de Flandes) is a novel written by Spanish author Arturo Pérez-Reverte in 1990, telling of a mystery hidden in an art masterpiece spanning from the 15th century to the present day.
Plot summary
Julia, an art restorer and evaluator living in Madrid , discovers a painted-over message on a 1471 Flemish masterpiece called La partida de ajedrez (The Chess Game) which reads "Quis Necavit Equitem", written in Latin ( English : "Who killed the knight?"). The painting appears as the cover of the book in some editions.
With the help of her old friend and father-figure, an antiques dealer named CÃ©sar, and MuÃ±oz, a quiet local chess master , Julia works to uncover the mystery of a 500-year-old murder. At the same time, however, Julia faces danger of her own; as several people helping her along her search are also murdered. [1]
