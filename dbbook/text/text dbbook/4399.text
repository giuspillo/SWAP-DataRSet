Plot summary
The now-adult Stevie Taggert, a tobacconist , makes a bet with an elderly John Moore that he can write the story of one of their adventures together as well as Moore (a former newspaper reporter) could.
Set in 1897, Dr. Lazlo Kreizler's associate, Sara Howard, now a private detective , comes to him for help in locating Ana Linares, the kidnapped infant daughter of a visiting Spanish dignitary. The mystery is complicated by rising tensions between Spain and the United States , and war in Cuba seems inevitable. Kreizler re-convenes his old "team": Sara, John, NYPD detectives and forensic specialists Marcus and Lucius Isaacson, and Kreizler's faithful servants, Stevie and Cyrus. Their search for the missing child leads them to contact with an enigmatic woman with a murderous past, who enjoys the protection of the Hudson Dusters , a notorious gang.
Their investigations force the team to ask, within the context of their era, a complex ethical question: could the act of a woman murdering her own child be seen as her trying to gain control over her life and her world?
