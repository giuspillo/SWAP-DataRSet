Summary and themes
Mickey Sabbath (modeled after American Jewish painter R.B. Kitaj [2] ) is an unproductive, out-of-work, former puppeteer with a strong affinity for whores , adultery , and the casual sexual encounter. Sabbath takes great pleasure in his status as the (prototypical) "dirty old man." He takes an equal pleasure in manipulating the people around him, primarily womenâ€”in a sense, they play the same role as his puppets. The loss of a decades-long sexual sidekickâ€”the equally depraved Drenkaâ€”precipitates a crisis in a life he has long considered an utter failure. Sabbath wonders whether he should simply take his own life, thereby heeding the advice of the ghost of his departed mother, a frequent visitor who urges suicide as the fitting end for his failed life.
Reception
Literary critic Harold Bloom has declared Sabbath's Theater Roth's "masterwork." [3] Prominent literary critic James Wood told Morning News , "I am a great fan of Sabbathâ€™s Theater, it was an extraordinary book." [4] New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani found it hard to finish and "distasteful and disingenuous". [5]
It won the National Book Award for fiction. [1] â€” thirty-five years after Roth's debut novel Goodbye Columbus won the same award (1960). It was also a finalist for the 1996 Pulitzer Prize . [6]
