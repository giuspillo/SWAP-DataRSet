Plot summary
In these stories from Conan's late 30s, the Cimmerian becomes involved in the civil wars of a lost city, a contest over treasure in the black kingdoms, and the border wars between the kingdom of Aquilonia and the savage Picts in the wilderness to the west.
Chronologically, the three short stories collected as Conan the Warrior fall between Conan the Buccaneer and Conan the Usurper .
