The Hidden Family is the second book of Charles Stross' alternate history, science fiction series The Merchant Princes. It completes the story begun in The Family Trade (2004); the two were originally written as one novel. They are followed by The Clan Corporate (2006), the first part of the second story.
Reception
Publishers Weekly in their review said "Stross continues to mix high and low tech in amusing and surprising ways. However, while giving a gritty SF portrait of the marvels of modern market economics and correcting the too pretty portrait of too many medieval fantasy lands, he sometimes overlooks the realities that constrain both. Still, less historically minded readers can lose themselves in Miriam's attempts to survive the Clan's equally dangerous high-stakes business and social games. Stross weaves a tale worthy of Robert Ludlum or Dan Brown ." [1] Roland Green reviewing the book for Booklist compared it to the early novels in Roger Zelazny's Amber series. [2]
