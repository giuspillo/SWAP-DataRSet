The Bridges at Toko-Ri is a novella by American author James A. Michener. The book details the experiences of United States Navy pilots in the Korean War as they undertake a mission to destroy heavily protected bridges in enemy territory.
Influences
In 1951, Michener, a former Naval officer was on the aircraft carriers USS Essex and USS Valley Forge then offshore in Korea. He was doing a series of articles for The Saturday Evening Post on the Korean air war. [2] The rescue climax of the story echoes the exploits of Lt. John Kelvin Koelsch who was the first helicopter pilot awarded the Medal of Honor and Duane Thorin, a helicopter pilot on the USS Rochester . [3]
Film adaptation
The Bridges at Toko-Ri was made into a film of the same name in 1954 by Paramount Pictures , just one year after the book's publication. Starring Grace Kelly and William Holden , it was directed by Mark Robson , who had also brought Return to Paradise , another Michener book, to screen one year earlier. Commander Marshall Beebe who led the Carrier Squadron when Michener was aboard acted as technical adviser to the film and had a cameo role in the film as a pilot. [4]
Further Reading
The book Such Men As These, published in 2010 by David Sears, uses "Michenerâ€™s notes to follow the real-life aviators from the day they left home to the truce that ended the war...Sears also follows Michenerâ€™s own progress in writing [The Bridges at Toko-Ri], which many veterans felt was the best depiction of their experience on the ground and in the sky."
