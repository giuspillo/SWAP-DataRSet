Summary
The book begins when a retired couple, Emile and Juliette Hazel, achieve their dream of buying a house in the woods to live alone together, far from the public world.
Nobody lives around the house except an old doctor, PalamÃ¨de Bernadin, and his wife, Bernadette, in a little house. To be polite, Emile and Juliette decide to meet them, and thus come in contact with PalamÃ¨de Bernardin, who develops the habit of coming into their house everyday precisely at 4pm, sitting in an armchair and waiting until 6pm, barely saying a word, at which time he, ever punctually, goes back home. The visits become slowly more and more unbearable, until the Hazels resolve to get rid of him. But by what means?
