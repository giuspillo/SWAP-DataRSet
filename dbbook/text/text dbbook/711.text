Plot summary
The Ds return to Norfolk , hoping to enjoy a holiday with their friends of the Coot Club . Unfortunately, they find the Death and Glories coming under a gathering cloud of suspicion of setting moored boats adrift.
Everywhere they go, boats seem to be cast adrift; and they are threatened with being forbidden to sail. Things get worse when new shackles are stolen from a boatbuilder after one of the casting off episodes and some of them are found aboard the Death and Glory. At the same time, the boys seem to be flush with cash, but they won't say where they got it.
The Big Six (Dick, Dorothea, Tom Dudgeon, and the three Death and Glories) get together to investigate the crimes and collect evidence. Eventually a carefully prepared trap is sprung and in a flash (literally, to take a night photo of the real culprits) the villains are discovered and the boys are exonerated. The source of their secret supply of money is uncovered when a local pub unveils a magnificent stuffed pike .
