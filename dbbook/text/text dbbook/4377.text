Various publications from different types of media have commented on Reborn!. The Mainichi Shimbun newspaper has noted Reborn! to have one of the highest number of cosplayers in Japan. [63] Carlos Santos from Anime News Network noted the first volume from the manga to have several episodic chapters in which the plot does not go to the important parts of the series and that the art was "downright messy and crowded", but noted the "volatile chemistry" between Tsuna and Reborn to be very likely. [64] Popcultureshock.com noted the series to be aimed for girls due to the large number of male characters appearing in the chapters and mentioned the series has a good combination of artwork and humor, making jokes repeated gags very funny. [5] A. E. Sparrow from IGN praised the artwork from the manga due to the "cartoonish characters exist alongside chiseled, well-sculpted figures" and liked how it jokes with the "Mafia concept" since most of it is comedy. [6] The change of the series' tone has also met various responses. In a review from the ninth volume, Sparrow noted the series "is quickly becoming a great shÅ�nen read in no small part due to this current storyline" and noted the manga evolved since the character start to grow up and the fights became more violent. [8] Comicbookbin.com mentions that though they liked that the fights were well made and the comedy was still in the series, volume 8 of the manga becomes too violent and that its common reader may find it strange. [7] Ben Leary from Mania Entertainment expressed mixed comments about the series' darker tone since the eighth volume, praising the way the fights are done and how the tournament between the Vongola and the Varia was handled. [65] Nevertheless, he still missed the series' comedy, wishing a refresher following the tournament's ending. [66]
