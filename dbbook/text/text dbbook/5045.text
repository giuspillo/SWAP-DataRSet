The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate is a 1995 book by Gary Chapman. It outlines five ways to express love that Chapman calls "love languages": gifts, quality time, words of affirmation, acts of service, and physical touch. After reading the book, Mindy Meier suggested food as a sixth love language. Chapman's book claims that the list of five love languages is exhaustive. Chapman argues that, emotionally, people need to receive love. He also writes that people should not use the love languages that they like the most but rather the love languages that their loved ones can receive. Since 1995, Chapman has written several books related to The Five Love Languages, including The Five Love Languages of Children in 1997 and The Five Love Languages for Singles in 2004. In 2012, Grayson County, Kentucky, Clear Choices Pregnancy Resources Center offered a course on the topic of sexual integrity that employed The Five Love Languages and two other Christian books as its basis, the other two being Eric and Leslie Ludy's When God Writes Your Love Story and Bill and Pam Farrel's Single Men Are Like Waffles — Single Women Are Like Spaghetti. Andy Andrews called Chapman's book "amazing" and credited The Five Love Languages with inspiring a portion of his own book The Noticer. Marybeth Whalen wrote that Chapman's book helped her understand her husband Curt in many ways.
