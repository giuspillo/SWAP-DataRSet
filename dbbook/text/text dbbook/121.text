World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War is a 2006 post-apocalyptic horror novel by Max Brooks. It is a follow-up to his 2003 book, The Zombie Survival Guide. Rather than a grand overview or narrative, World War Z is a collection of individual accounts in the form of first-person anecdotes. Brooks plays the role of an agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission, who published the report a decade after the ten-year Zombie War. The United Nations left much of his research out of the official report, choosing to focus on facts and figures from the war rather than the individual stories that form the bulk of Brooks' novel. The interviews chart a decade-long war against zombies from the view point of many different people of various nationalities. The personal accounts also describe the religious, geo-political, and environmental changes as a result of the Zombie War. World War Z was inspired by The Good War, an oral history of World War II by Studs Terkel; and by the zombie films of director George A. Romero. Brooks used World War Z to comment on social issues like government ineptitude and American isolationism, while also examining themes of survivalism and uncertainty. Critics have praised the novel for reinventing the zombie genre; the audiobook version, performed by a full cast including Alan Alda, Mark Hamill and John Turturro, won an Audie Award in 2007. A film based upon the book is in production, and is set for a June 2013 release.
Summary
Through a series of oral interviews compiled by the narrator (an agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission), the story of the global war against zombies, "World War Z," is told. The zombie pandemic 's " patient zero " was a young infected boy in China, although it is implied that the boy was not the first victim chronologically, but his infection (as well as those he infected) is the first to be recorded, and marked the point the Chinese government attempts to contain the infection and concocts a crisis involving Taiwan to mask their activities. Regardless, the infection spreads to other countries by the black market organ trade and by refugees, with a larger outbreak in South Africa bringing the plague to public attention.
As the infection spreads, Israel abandons the Palestinian territories and initiates a nationwide quarantine , closing its borders to everyone except uninfected Jews and Palestinians. It then puts down an ultra-Orthodox uprising, which is later referred to as an Israeli civil war. Pakistan and Iran destroy each other in a nuclear war after the Iranian government attempts to stem the flow of refugees fleeing through Pakistan into Iran. The United States does little to prepare because it is overconfident in its ability to suppress any threat. Although special forces teams contain initial outbreaks, a widespread effort never starts: the nation is deprived of political will by " brushfire wars ", and a widely distributed and marketed placebo vaccine creates a false sense of security. As many more areas around the globe fall to infection, a period known as the "Great Panic" begins. Following the fall of New York City , the U.S. military sets up a high-profile defense at Yonkers, New York . The "Battle of Yonkers" is a disaster; modern weapons and tactics prove ineffective against zombies, which "can't be shocked and awed "[ citation needed ] as they have no self-preservation instincts, and can only be stopped if shot through the head. The unprepared and demoralized soldiers are routed on live television. Other countries suffer similarly disastrous defeats, and human civilization teeters on the brink of destruction.
In South Africa, the government adopts a contingency drafted by apartheid -era intelligence consultant Paul Redeker, which calls for the establishment of small sanctuaries, leaving large groups of survivors abandoned in special zones in order to distract the undead, allowing those within the main safe zone time to regroup and recuperate. Governments worldwide assume similar plans or relocate the populace to safer foreign territory, such as the complete evacuation of the Japanese Home Islands . Because zombies freeze solid in the cold, many civilians in North America flee to the wildernesses of northern Canada and the Arctic , where millions of people die of starvation and hypothermia . It is implied that some turn to cannibalism to survive; further interviews from other sources imply that cannibalism occurred in areas of the United States where food shortages occurred. The three remaining astronauts in the International Space Station survive the war by salvaging supplies from the abandoned Chinese space station, and maintain some military and civilian satellites using various pods attached to the ISS and the orbital fuel station. A surviving member of the ISS crew describes "mega swarms"[ citation needed ] of zombies on the American Great Plains and Central Asia and how pollution affected Earth's atmosphere. The U.S. eventually establishes safe zones west of the Rocky Mountains , and spends much of the next decade eradicating zombies in that region. All aspects of civilian life are devoted to supporting the war effort against the pandemic. Much of it resembles total war strategies: rationing of fuel and food, cultivation of private gardens, and civilian neighborhood patrols. The U.S. government also initiates a "Re-education Act" to train the civilian population for the war effort and restore order. The people with skills such as carpentry and construction find themselves more valuable than people with managerial skills.
Seven years after the outbreak began, a conference is held off the coast of Honolulu, Hawaii , aboard the USS Saratoga , where most of the world's leaders argue that they can outlast the zombie plague if they stay in their safe zones. The U.S. President, however, argues for going on the offensive. Determined to lead by example, the U.S. military reinvents itself to meet the specific strategic requirements of fighting the undead: using semi-automatic, high-power rifles and volley firing , focusing on head shots and slow, steady rates of fire; and devising a multipurpose hand tool, the "Lobotomizer" or "Lobo" (described as a combination of a shovel and a battle axe ), for close-quarters combat. The military, backed by a resurgent American wartime economy, began the decade-long process of retaking the continental United States from both the undead as well as groups of hostile human survivors. Prewar military doctrines and equipment is mentioned as being employed to deal with sometime well-armed and organized criminal or rebel opposition.
Ten years after the official end of the zombie war, millions of zombies are still active, mainly on the ocean floor or on snow-line islands. A democratic Cuba has become the world's most thriving economy and the international banking capital. China has also become a democracy, following a civil war sparked by the collapse of the Three Gorges Dam and ending after a mutinying Chinese Navy submarine destroys the Communist leadership with submarine-launched ballistic missiles . Tibet, freed from Chinese rule, hosts the world's most populated city . Following a religious revolution, Russia is now an expansionist theocracy . Owing to the fact that many young Russians either became zombies, were infected with HIV or died due to drugs, the government has initiated a "breeding" program, with the remaining fertile women implied to be coercively impregnated to raise the birthrate. North Korea is completely empty, with the entire population presumed to have disappeared into underground bunkers. Iceland has been completely depopulated, and is the world's most heavily infested country. The situation in the British Isles is not entirely clear in the novel. It is strongly implied that Ireland and the Isle of Man have avoided any major outbreaks, as the Pope and members of the royal family had fled there. However, the United Kingdom is described as intact, [1] following the military retreat to the Antonine Wall and now exports oil from a reserve under Windsor Castle where the Queen held out for the war's duration, refusing to flee with her relatives; for unknown reasons, the oil fields in Saudi Arabia have been destroyed by the Saudi royal family . In France, the Palace of Versailles was the site of a massacre and had been burned to the ground; military losses were particularly high clearing the catacombs underneath Paris , due to the fact that the catacombs housed nearly a quarter of a million refugees during the early stages of the war, all of whom became zombies.
The Israelis and Palestinians have made peace and Israel and its former occupied territories have been renamed "Unified Palestine". Mexico is now known as " AztlÃ¡n ". Several countries are described as having revised borders due to the "dumping" of convicts into infected zones; these convicts rose to command "powerful fiefdoms" that later became independent states. There is also mention of a "Pacific Continent," which appears to encompass previously uninhabited islands as well as ships rendered immobile due to lack of fuel.
The United Nations fields a large military force to eliminate the remaining zombies from overrun areas, defeat hordes that surface from the ocean floor, and kill frozen zombies before they thaw. Life on Earth is hinted at being brought to near extinction.
Development
Brooks designed World War Z to follow the "laws" set up in his earlier work, The Zombie Survival Guide , and explained that the guide may exist in the novel's fictional universe . [2] The zombies of The Zombie Survival Guide are human bodies reanimated by an incurable virus, devoid of intelligence and desirous solely to consume living flesh, and can not be killed unless the brain is destroyed. Decomposition will eventually set in, but this process takes longer than an uninfected body, and can be slowed by effects such as freezing. Although zombies do not tire and are as strong as the humans they infect, they are slow-moving and incapable of planning or cooperation in their attacks. Zombies usually reveal their presence by moaning. [3]
Max Brooks (right) with George Romero
Brooks discussed the cultural influences on the novel. He claimed inspiration from The Good War by Studs Terkel . Brooks stated: "[Terkel's book is] an oral history of World War II. I read it when I was a teenager and it's sat with me ever since. When I sat down to write World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, I wanted it to be in the vein of an oral history." [2] Brooks also cited renowned zombie film director George A. Romero as an influence, and criticized The Return of the Living Dead films: "They cheapen zombies, make them silly and campy. They've done for the living dead what the old Batman TV show did for The Dark Knight ." [2] Brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel, including one to alien robot franchise Transformers , but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently. [2]
Brooks conducted copious research while writing World War Z. The technology, politics, economics, culture, and military tactics were based on a variety of reference books and consultations with expert sources. [4] Brooks also cites the U.S. Army as a reference on firearm statistics. [5]
Social commentary
Reviewers have noted that Brooks uses World War Z as a platform to criticize government ineptitude, corporate corruption, and human short-sightedness. [6] [7] At one point in the book, a Palestinian refugee living in Kuwait refuses to believe that the dead are rising, fearing it is a trick by Israel. Many American characters blame the United States' inability to counter the zombie threat on low confidence in the government due to conflicts in the Middle East. [8] Brooks also shows his particular dislike of government bureaucracy. One character in the novel tries to justify lying about the zombie outbreak to avoid widespread panic, while at the same time failing to develop a solution for fear of arousing public ire. [9] [10]
Brooks has also criticized American isolationism :
I love my country enough to admit that one of our national flaws is isolationism. I wanted to combat that in World War Z and maybe give my fellow Americans a window into the political and cultural workings of other nations. Yes, in World War Z some nations come out as winners and some as losers, but isn't that the case in real life as well? I wanted to base my stories on the historical actions of the countries in question, and if it offends some individuals, then maybe they should reexamine their own nation's history. [2]
Survivalism
Survivalism and disaster preparation are other prevalent themes in the novel. Several interviews, especially those from the United States, focus on policy changes designed to train the surviving Americans to fight the zombies and rebuild the country. [8] For example, when cities were made to be as efficient as possible in order to fight the zombies, the plumber could hold a higher status than the former C.E.O. And when the ultra-rich hid in their homes, which had been turned into fortified compounds, they were overwhelmed by others trying to get in, leading to mass slaughter. Throughout the novel, characters demonstrate the physical and mental requirements needed to survive a disaster. [11] Brooks described the large amount of research needed to find optimal methods for fighting a worldwide zombie outbreak. He also pointed out that Americans like the zombie genre because they believe they can survive anything with the right tools and talent. [4]
Fear and uncertainty
Brooks considers the theme of uncertainty central to the zombie genre. He believes that zombies allow people to deal with their own anxiety about the end of the world. [12] Brooks has expressed a deep fear of zombies:
They scare me more than any other fictional creature out there because they break all the rules. Werewolves and vampires and mummies and giant sharks , you have to go look for them. My attitude is if you go looking for them, no sympathy. But zombies come to you. Zombies don't act like a predator; they act like a virus, and that is the core of my terror. A predator is intelligent by nature, and knows not to overhunt its feeding ground. A virus will just continue to spread, infect and consume, no matter what happens. It's the mindlessness behind it. [13]
This mindlessness is connected to the context in which Brooks was writing. He declared: "at this point we're pretty much living in an irrational time", full of human suffering and lacking reason or logic. [14] When asked in a subsequent interview about how he would compare terrorists with zombies, Brooks said:
The lack of rational thought has always scared me when it came to zombies, the idea that there is no middle ground, no room for negotiation. That has always terrified me. Of course that applies to terrorists, but it can also apply to a hurricane, or flu pandemic , or the potential earthquake that I grew up with living in L.A . Any kind of mindless extremism scares me, and we're living in some pretty extreme times. [4]
Reception
Reviews for the novel have been generally positive. Gilbert Cruz of Entertainment Weekly gave the novel an "A" rating, commenting that the novel shared with great zombie stories the use of a central metaphor, describing it as "an addictively readable oral history." [11] Steven H. Silver identified Brooks' international focus as the novel's greatest strength and commented favorably on Brooks' ability to create an appreciation for the work needed to combat a global zombie outbreak. Silver's only complaint was with "Good-Byes"â€”the final chapterâ€”in which characters get a chance to give a final closing statement. Silver felt that it was not always apparent who the sundry, undifferentiated characters were. [15] The Eagle described the book as being "unlike any other zombie tale" as it is "sufficiently terrifying for most readers, and not always in a blood-and-guts way, either." [10] Keith Phipps of The Onion 's The A.V. Club stated that the format of the novel makes it difficult for it to develop momentum, but found the novel's individual episodes gripping. [6] Patrick Daily of the Chicago Reader said the novel transcends the "silliness" of The Zombie Survival Guide by "touching on deeper, more somber aspects of the human condition." [16] In his review for Time Out Chicago, Pete Coco declared that "[b]ending horror to the form of alternative history would have been novel in and of itself. Doing so in the mode of Studs Terkel might constitute brilliance." [17]
Ron Currie Jr. named World War Z one of his favorite apocalyptic novels and praised Brooks for illustrating "the tacit agreement between writer and reader that is essential to the success of stories about the end of the world ... [both] agree to pretend that this is not fiction, that in fact the horrific tales of a war between humans and zombies are based in reality." [7] Drew Taylor of the Fairfield County Weekly credited World War Z with making zombies more popular in mainstream society. [18]
The hardcover version of World War Z spent four weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list , peaking at number nine. [19] [20] By November 2011, according to Publishers Weekly , World War Z has sold one million copies in all formats. [21]
Audiobook
An abridged audiobook was published in 2007 by Random House , directed by John Mc Elroy, produced by Dan Zitt, with sound editing by Charles De Montebello. The book is read by Brooks, but includes many other actors taking on the roles of the many individual characters who are interviewed in the novel. Brooks' previous career in voice acting and voice-over work meant he could recommend a large number of the cast members. [13]
On May 14, 2013, a lengthier audiobook was released by Random House Audio as World War Z: The Complete Edition (Movie Tie-in Edition): An Oral History of the Zombie War. It contains the entirety of the original, abridged audiobook, as well as new recordings of each missing segment. A separate, additional audiobook containing only the new recordings not found in the original audiobook was released simultaneously as World War Z: The Lost Files: A Companion to the Abridged Edition.
