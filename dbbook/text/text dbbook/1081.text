The Mirror of Love is an epic poem by Alan Moore , written in the form of a romantic letter. Sappho, Michelangelo, Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, Oscar Wilde, and many others are woven into this rich, visceral piece, which documents the history of same-sex love throughout mankind's history, and comments on its modern day state. It was originally written fourteen years ago in a comic form (as part of an AARGH! , or Artists Against Rampant Government Homophobia, comic anthology) as a protest against Britain's homophobic Section 28 . It was also converted into a stage production. In 2004, Moore teamed up with illustrator JosÃ© Villarrubia , and the duo re-released the work, adding photographs to each poetic passage. [1]
