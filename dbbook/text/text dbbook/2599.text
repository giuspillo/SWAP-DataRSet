Make Way for Ducklings is a children's picture book written and illustrated by Robert McCloskey. First published in 1941, the book tells the story of a pair of mallard ducks who decide to raise their family on an island in the lagoon in Boston Public Garden, a park in the center of Boston, Massachusetts. Make Way for Ducklings won the 1942 Caldecott Medal for McCloskey's illustrations, executed in charcoal then lithographed on zinc plates. As of 2003, the book had sold over two million copies. The book's popularity led to the construction of a statue by Nancy Schön in the Public Garden of the mother duck and her eight ducklings, which is a popular destination for children and adults alike. In 1991, Barbara Bush gave a duplicate of this sculpture to Raisa Gorbachev as part of the START Treaty, and the work is displayed in Moscow's Novodevichy Park. The book is the official children's book of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Praise for the book is still high over 60 years since its first publication, mainly for the enhancing illustrations and effective pacing. It was criticised for having a loose plot, however, as well as poor characterization. The book is extremely popular worldwide.
Sales
Make Way for Ducklings has been continuously in print since it was first published. As of 2003, the book had sold over two million copies. [4] In September 2006 the hardcover edition of the book ranked #2,182 in sales at Amazon.com [10] and #1,838 in sales at Barnes & Noble . [11] The story has also been published in paperback and audiobook. [12]
The book, which received the 1942 Caldecott Medal for its illustrations, has continued to garner praise sixty years after its first publishing. When it was first released in 1941, Ellen Buell of The New York Times called the book "one of the merriest we have had in a long time", praising the understated comedic aspect of the procession down Beacon Street, as well as McCloskey's "fine large pictures" which simultaneously demonstrate "economy of line" and "wealth of detail". [13]
Critical commentary
One critic has stated that the illustrations cause the strength of the plot to suffer. One says the "loosely plotted" story gives no true explanation for why Mr. Mallard leaves the island in the Charles River or why the Mallards did not simply stay on the lagoon island in the first place and avoid the bicyclists on the shore. However, McCloskey has stated himself that he thinks of himself as an artist who writes children's books and not vice versa. One critic also find the characterization lacking, that is, the Mallards represent "rather stereotypically concerned parents", often showing the same facial expressions and rarely showing expressiveness. [2]
The drawings of Boston represent a duck's eye view of the city. Each of the individual ducklings are "bored, inquisitive, sleepy, or they are scratching, talking over their backs one to another, running to catch up with the line". Children identify with the ducklings because they behave as children do. The comforting message shows parents as caretakers, protectors, and teachers. [2]
Another critic has positively commented on McCloskey's use of page breaks as a pacing technique. McCloskey's use of one-sentence pages forces the reader to quickly turn the page, enhancing the sense of motion, especially during the home search and when Mrs. Mallard teaches the ducklings their basic skills. McCloskey also employs this page break method to heighten surprise. When searching for a home, Mr. and Mrs. Mallard seem to have found a home on page eleven. [8]
"'Good,' said Mr. Mallard, delighted that at last Mrs. Mallard had found a place that suited her. But â€”" (p. 11) [1]
Then, they encounter a sudden problem with the chosen location when Mrs. Mallard is nearly run over by a bicyclist on page thirteen. [8]
Gender roles
Make Way for Ducklings was published in the 1940s. Many books of the time portray a male dominated society, a trend which Make Way for Ducklings does not follow. [14] McCloskey presented Mrs. Mallard as an "independent and nonsubmissive female character." [15]
When Mr. Mallard leaves on questionable purpose, Mrs. Mallard is charged with raising their ducklings alone. McCloskey portrays Mrs. Mallard as a capable woman who does not need the support of a male character. This strong portrayal has led one critic to label the book as "pre-feminist." [16]
Surveys
Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named the book one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children." [17] It was one of the "Top 100 Picture Books" of all time in a 2012 poll by School Library Journal . [18]
Cultural effects
A bronze statue of the ducklings by Nancy SchÃ¶n is a popular attraction in Boston Public Garden. It is said the Ducks never need professional polishing because children sit on them so often. A replica installed in Moscow was a gift from United States First Lady Barbara Bush to Soviet First Lady Raisa Gorbachev .
The city of Boston, the setting of the book, has whole-heartedly embraced the story. In the Public Garden, where the Mallards eventually settled, a bronze statue has been erected of Mrs. Mallard and her eight ducklings. While the tallest statue stands only 38 inches (.97 meters) tall, the caravan of bronze ducks set in Boston cobblestone spans 35 feet (10.67 m) from front to back. The statue, installed October 4, 1987, was a tribute to Robert McCloskey "whose story ... has made the Boston Public Garden familiar to children throughout the world." [6]
Since 1978, the city has hosted an annual Duckling Day parade each spring, with children and their parents dressed as ducklings. Part of the route retraces the path taken by Mrs. Mallard and her ducklings to get to the Public Garden. [19] [20]
In 2000, schoolchildren from Canton, Massachusetts decided that the book was worthy of being the official children's book of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and went to their state legislature to get a bill passed declaring it so. However, legislators from Springfield, Massachusetts blocked the legislation on the grounds the official book should be by Springfield native Dr. Seuss . Legislators reached a compromise when they agreed to make Dr. Seuss the official children's author of the commonwealth and Make Way for Ducklings the official children's book. [21]
A statue similar to the one in the Boston Public Garden was erected in Novodevichy Park in Moscow as part of the START Treaty by Acton, Massachusetts landscape and construction company Capizzi & Co. Inc. on July 30, 1991. The equipment, statues, cobblestones, and workers were all flown by the US Air Force in a C5 containing the heavy equipment, diesel fuel, and other assorted tools they would need. The individual statues, which were in total length, 40 feet (12 m) long, were presented by then United States First Lady Barbara Bush to Russian First Lady Raisa Gorbachev as a gift to the children of the Soviet Union . [22] Four of the ducks were stolen, one in 1991 and three in February 2000. Thieves hoping to sell the ducks as scrap metal cut the statues off at the legs. The ducks were replaced in September 2000 at a rededication ceremony attended by former President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev . [23]
Films
Make Way for Ducklings was adapted into an 11 minute black-and-white cartoon created by Weston Woods in 1955. [24] Founded by educator Morton Schindel in 1953, Weston Woods Studios, Inc.(named after the wooded area outside his home in Weston, Connecticut ) specializes in animating children's picture books on film. The program is centered toward young struggling readers who, after watching the movie, are encouraged to read the books themselves. [25] [26]
In 1964, Schindel and Weston Woods Studios made the 18-minute Robert McCloskey, a documentary which is sometimes screened in art schools. The film shows McCloskey sitting in Boston Public Garden and intercuts pages from his sketchbook drawings for Make Way for Ducklings. The illustrator discusses experiences that have influenced his work and the relationship of craftsmanship to inspiration. [27]
Life imitates art
In 2008, in Spokane, Washington , and again in 2009 a mallard laid her eggs on the ledge above the door to a bank in downtown. She and her brood were assisted by an employee of the bank who caught the ducklings as they jumped from the 10-foot (3.0 m) ledge over a concrete sidewalk. Once all the ducklings were down the mother "paraded" them through city streets to the Spokane river, complete with a crowd of people stopping traffic, and someone holding up a "brake for ducks" sign.
