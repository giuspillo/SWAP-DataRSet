The Souls of Black Folk is a classic work of American literature by W. E. B. Du Bois. It is a seminal work in the history of sociology, and a cornerstone of African-American literary history. The book, published in 1903, contains several essays on race, some of which had been previously published in Atlantic Monthly magazine. Du Bois drew from his own experiences to develop this groundbreaking work on being African-American in American society. Outside of its notable place in African-American history, The Souls of Black Folk also holds an important place in social science as one of the early works to deal with sociology.
Chapters
Chapter I lays out an overview of Du Bois's thesis for the book. It says that the blacks of the South need the right to vote, a good education, and to be treated with equality and justice. It also defines his term double consciousness : "It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at oneâ€™s self through the eyes of others, of measuring oneâ€™s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity." [1]
The first chapter also introduces Du Bois' famous metaphor of the veil. According to Du Bois, this veil is worn by all African-Americans because their view of the world and its potential economic, political, and social opportunities is so vastly different from that of white people. The veil is a visual manifestation of the colour line, a problem Du Bois worked his whole life to remedy. Du Bois sublimates the function of the veil when he refers to it as a gift of second sight for African-Americans, thus simultaneously characterizing the veil as both a blessing and a curse. [2]
The second chapter, "The Dawn of Freedom" covers the history of the Freedmen's Bureau during reconstruction.
Chapters III through VI focus on education. It is here that Du Bois argues against Booker T. Washington 's idea of focusing solely on industrial education for black men. He also advocates the addition of a classical education to establish leaders and educators in the black community.
Chapters VII through X are sociological studies of the black community. Du Bois investigates the influence that segregation and discrimination have had on the black people. He argues that much of the negative stereotypes of blacks as lazy, violent, and simple-minded are results of the treatment from white people.
In "Chapter X: Of the Faith of the Fathers", Du Bois describes the rise of the Black church , and examines the history and contemporary state of religion and spiritualism among African-Americans.
The final chapters of the book are devoted to narratives of individuals. "Chapter XI: Of the Passing of the First-Born" tells the story of Du Bois's own son and his untimely death. In the next chapter, the life of Alexander Crummell is a short biography of a black priest in the Episcopal Church.
The penultimate chapter of The Souls of Black Folk, is a creative work, â€œOf the Coming of John.â€� This story is that of John from Altamaha, Georgia sent off to a well-off school only to return to place where â€œ[l]ittle had they understood of what he said, for he spoke an unknown tongueâ€� (Du Bois 170). Johnâ€™s return to the South has made him a foreigner in his own home, and he is forced to die while â€œsoftly humming the â€˜Song of the Brideâ€™â€� in German (Du Bois 176).
The last chapter is about Negro music and makes reference to the short musical passages at the beginning of each of the other chapters.
Sorrow Songs
In chapter 14, â€œOf the Sorrow Songs,â€� Du Bois heralds the â€œmelody of the slave songs,â€� or, the negro spiritual, as the â€œarticulate message of the slave to the world.â€� They are the music, he contests, not of the joyous black slave, as a good many whites had misread them, but â€œof an unhappy people, of the children of disappointment; they tell of death and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer world, of misty wander-ings and hidden ways.â€� [3] For Du Bois, the sorrow songs represented a black folk culture, with its origins in slavery, that was unadulterated by the civilizing impulses of a northern black church increasingly obsessed with respectability and Western aesthetic criteria. [4] Rather than vestiges of a backward time that should be purged from black repertoires and isolated from what Alain Locke called the â€œmodernization of the negroâ€� (coincident, for Locke, with urbanization), negro spirituals, for Du Bois, are where the souls of black folk past and present are found.
Du Bois passionately advocated for the preservation of the spiritual, along with Dvorak [ disambiguation needed ] and contemporary black aestheticians from Burleigh and Dett to Alain Locke and Zora Neale Hurston . [5] It is in the retrieval of black cultural folkways-particularly the Sorrow Songs-that one of the major complications of Du Bois project and, later, the Harlem Renaissance (where Hurston and Locke [6] debut their own retrievals) surfaces. For Du Bois' contention that the sorrow songs contain a notative excess, and untranscribable element Yolanda Pierce identifies as the "soul" of the sorrow songs. [7] The mappings of sound and signs that make up the languages of white Western culture would prove insufficient to many black literary critics of the 1920s and beyond, and debates over the ability to retrieve, or preserve, black folk-ways finds its roots in Du Bois' treatment of the sorrow songs, and his call for their rescue.
Critical reception
In Living Black History, Du Bois biographer Manning Marable observes:
Few books make history and fewer still become foundational texts for the movements and struggles of an entire people. The Souls of Black Folk occupies this rare position. It helped to create the intellectual argument for the black freedom struggle in the twentieth century. "Souls" justified the pursuit of higher education for Negroes and thus contributed to the rise of the black middle class . By describing a global color-line, Du Bois anticipated pan-Africanism and colonial revolutions in the Third World . Moreover, this stunning critique of how 'race' is lived through the normal aspects of daily life is central to what would become known as ' whiteness studies ' a century later. [8]
Each chapter in The Souls of Black Folk begins with a lyric epigraph, complete with a musical score of the melody. Along with traditional spirituals and African-American poetry, European and American poets such as Schiller, Fitzgerald, Whittier and Byron are also represented. These lyrics deal with sorrow, suffering, hope, and liberation.
Du Bois says of these slave songs:
â€œI know that these songs are the articulate message of the slave to the world.â€� [9]
