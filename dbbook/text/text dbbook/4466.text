Nerilka's Story is a science fiction novella{{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} by the American-Irish author Anne McCaffrey. It was her eighth book in the Dragonriders of Pern series. Moreta (1983) and its sequel Nerilka (1985) are companion stories, in that the latter narrates a second perspective on major events of the former. It was the first work in the series following publication of the The Atlas of Pern, and so is not covered in the Atlas.
Plot summary
Taking a different approach from all previous books in the series, Nerilka's Story has a non-dragonrider non-harper as its major viewpoint character. It is set during the events detailed in Moreta: Dragonlady of Pern . Nerilka is the daughter of a Lord Holder who turns her back on her life of luxury and sets out to fight the disease that threatens to kill all humans on Pern. According to a critic for the Chicago Tribune , Nerilka makes for an "intelligent, resourceful, selfless and, alas, homely" heroine. [3]
