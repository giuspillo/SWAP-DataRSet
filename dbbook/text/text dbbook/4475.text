Plot introduction
The novel concerns a tank-battle casualty reincarnated as a dispossessed god-figure who struggles against one of his two consorts to re-establish his dominion in the far future Gonwonlane.
Reception
Lin Carter ranked The Book of Ptath as van Vogt's "single best novel" [1] and tried to convince him to write a sequel. [2] R. D. Mullen, however, dismissed the novel, saying he saw no reason to include it in an SF library. [3]
