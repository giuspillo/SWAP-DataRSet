Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 satirical science fiction novel by American author Robert A. Heinlein. It tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a human who comes to Earth in early adulthood after being born on the planet Mars and raised by Martians. The novel explores his interaction with—and eventual transformation of—terrestrial culture. The title seems an allusion to the phrase in Exodus 2:22. According to Heinlein, the novel's working title was The Heretic. Several later editions of the book have promoted it as "The most famous Science Fiction Novel ever written". Heinlein got the idea for the novel when he and his wife had some brainstorming one evening in 1948, and she suggested a new version of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book, where a human child is raised by Martians instead of wolves. He decided to go further with the idea, and worked on the story on and off for more than a decade before it was complete. After having finished Stranger in a Strange Land, his editors at Putnam required him to drastically cut its original 220,000-word length down to 160,067 words. In 1962, this version received the Hugo Award for Best Novel. The book was a success from the start. Over the following years word-of-mouth caused sales to rise further, requiring numerous reprintings of the first Putnam edition. Eventually Stranger in a Strange Land became a cult classic. After Heinlein's death in 1988, his wife Virginia arranged to have the original uncut manuscript published in 1991. Critics disagree over which is superior: Heinlein preferred the original manuscript over the heavily-edited version which was initially published. There is similar contention over the two versions of Heinlein's Podkayne of Mars. In 2012 the US Library of Congress named it one of 88 "Books that Shaped America."
Mr. Sergi Rimsky
Mrs. Eleanora Alvarez Rimsky
Valentine Michael Smith â€” known as Michael Smith or "Mike"; the "Man from Mars", raised on Mars in the interval between the landing of his father's ship, the Envoy, and arrival of the second expedition, the Champion; about 20 years old when the Champion arrives and brings him to Earth.
Officers of the Champion. These people became "water brothers" to Mike on Mars or during the trip back, but this information is only revealed to Mike's earthbound human friends when they meet the officers.
Captain van Tromp
Dr. Mahmoud, nicknamed Stinky â€” semanticist, of Arab descent, and a devout Muslim; the second human (after Mike) to gain a working knowledge of the Martian language, though he does not "grok" the language.
Dr. Sven Nelson â€” ship's physician and personal physician to Mike at Bethesda Medical Center until he withdraws from the case in a confrontation with the Secretary General (see below)
Government officials â€” Several government officials have roles at least at the beginning
Secretary-General Joseph Douglas ("Joe Douglas") â€” the head of the Federation of Free States, which has evolved indirectly from the United Nations into a true world government.
Gil Berquist â€” assistant to Secretary Douglas. Mike makes him and a policeman disappear during a confrontation with Jill (see below).
Alice Douglas â€” (sometimes called "Agnes"), wife of Joe Douglas. As the First Lady , she controls her husband, making major economic, political, and staffing decisions. She frequently consults an astrologer , Becky Vesant (see below), for major decisions. It is implied that she is an agent of the same afterlife in which Foster, Digby, and later Mike find themselves.
Assemblyman Kung â€” de facto head of the Eastern Coalition, a political bloc opposed to Douglas in the Federation.
Senator Tom Boone â€” politician and senior member of the patriarchal Church of the New Revelation (Fosterite), who wants Mike's wealth and prestige to accrue to the faith.
Gillian (Jill) Boardman â€” frees Mike from his imprisonment at Bethesda Hospital where she is a nurse. Ben Caxton continuously proposes marriage to her throughout the book.
Ben Caxton â€” investigative journalist and potential boyfriend of Jill. He makes her aware of Mike's legal significance (potential ownership both of enormous amounts of Earthly wealth and the planet Mars itself, at least according to Federation law), and persuades her to bug Smith's hospital suite, revealing an attempt by Douglas to defraud Smith of this wealth and power.
James Cavendish â€” a Fair Witness employed by Ben in an attempt to expose a fake Man from Mars shown on stereovision. Fair Witnesses are a legal institution created to provide impartial and accurate observation of potentially contentious legal situations. The character Anne (see below) is also a Fair Witness.
Jubal Harshaw â€” popular writer, lawyer, and doctor, now semi-retired to a house in the Poconos northwest of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Harshaw's age is never given but is probably at least 80 by indirect indications. When Ben Caxton disappears, Jill takes Mike to Harshaw to defend his rights, but succeeds only when the authorities threaten Mike. Harshaw himself is addressed as "Father" by Mike in the book's later portions, and comes to perceive himself as such after Mike's death.
Anne â€” (no last name given) oldest and tallest of three female secretaries to Harshaw. Has total recall and Fair Witness standing (see Cavendish above).
Archangels â€” provide some commentary and act quite apart from the humans. A third archangel, Michael/Mike, is introduced by Foster to Digby at the very end of the book as Digby's new supervisor.
Foster â€” The founder of the Church of the New Revelation (Fosterite); apotheosis after poisoning by Digby.
Digby â€” Supreme Bishop Digby, Foster's successor as head of the Church of the New Revelation; apotheosis to angel under Foster after Smith causes him to disappear.
In the preface for the re-issued book, Virginia Heinlein writes
The given names of the chief characters have great importance to the plot. They were carefully selected: Jubal means "the father of all," Michael stands for "Who is like God".
Reception
Writing in The New York Times , Orville Prescott received the novel caustically, describing it as a "disastrous mishmash of science fiction, laborious humor, dreary social satire and cheap eroticism"; he characterized Stranger as "puerile and ludicrous", saying "when a non-stop orgy is combined with a lot of preposterous chatter, it becomes unendurable, an affront to the patience and intelligence of readers". [7]
Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale gave the original edition a mixed review, saying "the book's shortcomings lie not so much in its emancipation as in the fact that Heinlein has bitten off too large a chewing portion." [8]
Proselytes
In 1968, Tim Zell (now Oberon Zell-Ravenheart ) and others formed a neo-pagan religious organization called the Church of All Worlds , modeled after the religion founded by the primary characters in the novel. [9] Except for correspondence with Zell (a lengthy letter to Zell appears as a letter to "a Fan" toward the end of the book in Grumbles from the Grave ) and a paid subscription to the Church's Green Egg magazine during the 1970s (as Heinlein refused to accept a complimentary subscription), Heinlein had no other connection to the project. [10]
Fair Witness
Fair Witness is a fictional profession invented for the novel. A Fair Witness is an individual trained to observe events and report exactly what he or she sees and hears, making no extrapolations or assumptions. An eidetic memory is a prerequisite for the job, although this may be attainable with suitable training.
In Heinlein's society, a Fair Witness is a highly reputable source of information. By custom, a Fair Witness acting professionally, generally wearing distinctive white robes, is never addressed directly, and is never acknowledged by anyone present.
The character Jubal Harshaw employs a Fair Witness, Anne, as one of his secretaries. Unlike the other secretaries, she does not use dictation equipment when Jubal speaks, and can keep track of several works at once, despite Harshaw's frequent switching among them.
Fair Witnesses are prohibited from drawing conclusions about what they observe. As a demonstration, Harshaw asks Anne to describe the color of a house in the distance. She responds, "It's white on this side"; whereupon Harshaw explains that she would not assume knowledge of the color of the other sides of the house without being able to see them. Furthermore, after observing another side of the house she would not then assume that any previously seen side was still the same color as last reported, even if only minutes before.
When Ben Caxton decides to do something that might result in litigation â€”namely, accusing a government official of substituting an actor for Valentine Michael Smith in a televised interviewâ€”he hires a highly respected Witness, James Oliver Cavendish, to record everything he sees, and to ensure that Ben is not accused of slander. They visit the alleged Man From Mars in his hospital suite in the hope of determining whether he is actually Smith or the actor who had apparently impersonated him the night before. Once they have left the suite Cavendish, now off duty as Witness, mentions that Ben should have looked for telltale calluses on the supposed Smith's feet. Ben immediately wants to go back, but Cavendish states that, having pointed this out to him, he can no longer serve as a Fair Witness for this case, and Ben would need to procure another Fair Witness. Frustrated by the professional ethics of the Fair Witness profession, Ben must make other plans to prove the identity of Mr. Smith.
Literary significance and criticism
Like many influential works of literature, Stranger made a contribution to the English language: specifically, the word " grok ". In Heinlein's invented Martian language, "grok" literally means "to drink" and figuratively means "to comprehend", "to love", and "to be one with". One dictionary description was "To understand thoroughly through having empathy with". This word rapidly became common parlance among science fiction fans, hippies, and computer hackers, and has since entered the Oxford English Dictionary among others.
The phrase "I am but an egg," which came into common usage during the 1960s[ citation needed ], paraphrases a line from Stranger in a Strange Land: "I am only an egg". [11] The phrase means, roughly, "I am a lowly novice, barely able to understand the concepts in question".[ citation needed ]
A central element of the second half of the novel is the religious movement founded by Smith, the "Church of All Worlds", an initiatory mystery religion blending elements of paganism and revivalism with psychic training and instruction in the Martian language. In 1968, Oberon Zell-Ravenheart (then Tim Zell) founded the Church of All Worlds , a Neopagan religious organization modeled in many ways after the fictional organization in the novel. This spiritual path included several ideas from the book, including polyamory , non-mainstream family structures, social libertarianism, water-sharing rituals, an acceptance of all religious paths by a single tradition, and the use of several terms such as "grok", "Thou art God", and "Never Thirst". Though Heinlein was neither a member nor a promoter of the Church, it was formed including frequent correspondence between Zell and Heinlein, and he was a paid subscriber to their magazine Green Egg .[ citation needed ] This Church still exists as a 501(c)(3) recognized religious organization incorporated in California , with membership worldwide, and it remains an active part of the neopagan community today. [12]
Stranger was written in part as a deliberate attempt to challenge social mores. In the course of the story, Heinlein uses Smith's open-mindedness to reevaluate such institutions as religion , money, monogamy , and the fear of death. Heinlein completed writing it ten years after he had (uncharacteristically) plotted it out in detail. He later wrote, "I had been in no hurry to finish it, as that story could not be published commercially until the public mores changed. I could see them changing and it turned out that I had timed it right." [13]
Stranger contains an early description of the waterbed , an invention which made its real-world debut a few years later in 1968. Charles Hall, who brought a waterbed design to the United States Patent Office , was refused a patent on the grounds that Heinlein's descriptions in Stranger and another novel, Double Star , constituted prior art . [14]
Heinlein reportedly named his main character "Smith" because of a speech he made at a science fiction convention regarding the unpronounceable names assigned to extraterrestrials. After describing the importance of establishing a dramatic difference between humans and aliens, Heinlein concluded, "Besides, whoever heard of a Martian named Smith?" ("A Martian Named Smith" was both Heinlein's working title for the book and the name of the screenplay started by Harshaw at the end). [15] The title "Stranger in a strange land" is taken from Exodus 2:22 "And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom : for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land".
In popular culture
Billy Joel 's 1989 song " We Didn't Start The Fire " refers to the book as an example of 1960s-era sexual freedom and liberation ideas.
Heinlein's 1941 novella Lost Legacy lends its theme, and possibly some characters to Stranger. In a relevant part of the story, Joan Freeman is described as feeling like "a stranger in a strange land". [16]
Editions
Two major versions of this book exist:
The 1961 version, which was cut 27.24% from Heinlein's original manuscript by the publisher[ citation needed ] due to the excessive length and to excise objectionable material.
The 1991 version, retrieved from Heinlein's archives in the University of California, Santa Cruz , Special Collections Department by his widow and published posthumously, which reproduces the original manuscript and restores all cuts. Both Heinlein's agent and his publisher (which had new senior editors) agreed that the uncut version was better: readers are used to longer books, and what was seen as objectionable in 1961 was no longer so thirty years later.
