Third Girl is a work of detective fiction by Agatha Christie and first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in November 1966 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at eighteen shillings (18/-) and the US edition at $4.50. It features her Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and the recurring character Ariadne Oliver. The novel is notable for being the first in many years in which Poirot is more or less present from beginning to end. It is also notable in that there is no clear crime to be investigated until comparatively late in the novel.
Plot summary
When a young woman visited Hercule Poirot to seek his help regarding a murder that she believed herself to have committed, she was appalled by his age and left with her story untold. Poirot wanted to track her down: he feared for her â€¦ but who was she, and what, if anything, had she done?
Poirot's acquaintance, the mystery writer Ariadne Oliver, provided him with a number of key clues in the novel, beginning with the identity of the girl, Norma Restarick, whom she had met at a party. Mrs. Oliver and Poirot began to investigate Norma, but soon find that she had gone missing. Mrs. Oliver met the girls with whom Norma shared a flat at 67 Borodene Mansions: Claudia Reece-Holland (the first girl, who was secretary to Norma's father and herself daughter of an MP) and Frances Cary (the second girl, an artsy girl with long, dark hair that fell across her face). Neither had seen Norma recently. Norma was the third girl, who was given lodging by the other two to help pay the rent.
With no client, hence no legitimate reason to be involved with Norma and family, Poirot had to fabricate a reason for visiting her paternal great uncleâ€™s home in the small village of Long Basing. There he found that her stepmother also had no idea where she had gone. Poirot met David Baker, Normaâ€™s boyfriend, there, and noticed that Normaâ€™s stepmother, Mary, was highly annoyed to discover Baker roaming inside the house. Baker was in untidy, 1960â€™s garb, with modern manners that offended Mary. Poirot then met Normaâ€™s paternal great-uncle, Sir Roderick Horsefield, who was elderly and had poor memory and eyesight. Normaâ€™s father, Andrew Restarick, had been staying with Sir Roderick since returning from Africa, where Andrew had made a vast fortune. Poirot surreptitiously searched the rooms of the house, finding a tuft of mud in Normaâ€™s room, which to him indicated that David had searched there. On the drive back to London, Poirot picked up Baker by the side of the road, and questioned about the family and relationships, establishing that Baker had no knowledge of where Norma was.
Mrs. Oliver provided a second essential lead when she happened across Baker and Norma in a cafÃ©. Dramatically, she changed her appearance and listened to them. She telephoned Poirot, who came to meet Norma, while she herself tracked Baker. In conversation with Norma Poirot learned that she feared that she tried to poison her stepmother, but was unsure since she often had moments where she had no memory. She had found in her bureau a vial of weed killer and later a knife with blood on it. Did she stab or poison someone? Oliver followed Baker to a dingy artistâ€™s studio, where Normaâ€™s flat-mate Frances was posing as a model for Bakerâ€™s artist friend Peter. Leaving the studio Mrs. Oliver was knocked unconscious from behind.
Meanwhile, Norma awakened to find herself in the safe keeping of John Stillingfleet, a family physician, having apparently thrown herself under an oncoming car. In a red herring that was easily spotted by those who recognize the doctor from an earlier novel with Poirot, it seemed that Stillingfleet might have kidnapped Norma. We learn later that Poirot hid her from danger in arrest home, and she was not seen again for much of the novel.
Poirot received a letter from Andrew Restarick, asking for his early appearance at his office in London. When Poirot arrived, the letter shocked Restarick; he called it a forgery, contrasting his signature on a check (made out to David Baker) to the letter. Poirot gained his confidence and induced Restarick to tell him his worries about Norma, including her possible poisoning of Mary. He employed Poirot to find Norma and insisted that the police were not to become involved.
Adriane Oliver awoke in a hospital and blurted out a delirious boggle of a story. She was sure that The Peacock (her name for David Baker) had bludgeoned her. Poirot reminded her that he cautioned her previously to be careful.
Then Sir Roderick contacted Poirot seeking help. He had lost letters written by a third party during the Second World War, which could cause embarrassment, should they be made public. Poirot agreed to investigate on his behalf.
Poirot had asked his long-time intelligence agent, Mr. Goby, to investigate the parties. He reported that Restarick, his wife, daughter, and brother all seemed to have respectable backgrounds. Baker was said to be shady, â€œof interest to the police,â€� and a man who lived off his women acquaintances. Goby also said that he saw Sir Roderickâ€™s personal assistant, Sonia, passing secrets to a representative of the Herzegovinian Embassy at Kew Gardens. Later, Sonia visited Poirot to deny that she had stolen anything.
Mrs. Oliver gave Poirot another key clue: she fortuitously heard while at Borodene Mansions that a woman committed suicide by throwing herself out of the window of Flat 76. This, Poirot inferred, must be the murder that Norma believed that she committed. Investigating the dead woman, Poirot discovered that her real name was Louise Carpenter, who was the woman who Andrew Restarick loved many years earlier when he left Normaâ€™s mother. When Poirot consulted Inspector Neele from Scotland Yard who was investigating the case, he learned that Louise also had a six-month affair with Claudia Reece-Hollandâ€™s father, the MP. Poirotâ€™s head spun with â€œtoo many facts, and no pattern.â€� Later Mrs. Oliver gave Poirot a draft letter in which Louise attempted to make contact once more with Andrew: an item that had coincidentally come into her possession early in the novel when it fell from a drawer being removed from the now-unoccupied flat 76.
Among the blizzard of clues besetting Poirot, several are only explained at the end of the book. Mary Restarick wore a wig, to which the readerâ€™s attention was repeatedly drawn by the fact that Mrs. Oliverâ€™s hairpieces are often mentioned as a plot device. Indeed Mrs. Oliver altered her hair in order to be in disguise when she saw Norma and David in the cafÃ©. Also, Poirot noticed that a pair of portraits of Andrew Restarick and of his first wife (Normaâ€™s mother) was in their home: why was Mary Restarick apparently content to have a picture of her predecessor on display, and why did Andrew later split the set to have his own portrait in his office?
Poirot visited Wedderburn Gallery, an art gallery that had been involved in sale of a possible forgery to a wealthy but ignorant Texan. Frances Cary, the second girl and model for Baker, worked there, arranging art shows for young artists. He thought that like David Baker, the Gallery would â€œdo a crooked deal of any kind for money.â€� As he pondered the facts, Poirot thought that Money seemed to play a central position in this case. And yet nothing firmly connected Norma to a murder, or even an attempted poisoning!
Dr. Stillingfleet contacted Poirot to say that Norma walked out on him unexpectedly. She saw a message in the personal column of a newspaper calling her to the flat, where she was discovered by Frances Cary standing over the dead body of David Baker with a knife, the murder weapon, in her hand. Norma immediately claimed responsibility for the murder to a neighbor, Miss Jacobs. Norma had been, however, subjected to a cocktail of drugs intended to disorient her and make her susceptible to the suggestion that she was a murderer. A critical clue in her favor was that she recalled the blood on the knife was sticky, although she had been in the apartment only five minutes, so the blood could not have been sticky by them.
In the denouement Poirot revealed his solution. First, the man posing as Andrew Restarick was an impostor, Robert Orwell, who took the real Restarickâ€™s place when he died in Africa. Orwell persuaded David Baker to paint his portrait in style with the original one, which established to anyone who questioned it that the new â€œRestarickâ€� had looked much the same fifteen years earlier when the pair was painted. Mary Restarick, meanwhile, was leading a double life, as both his wife Mary and as Frances Cary, whom she could become by changing wigs. This allowed Cary to continue her high living in the art world, while still playing the docile wife Mary.
Two people, however, could reveal the imposture: David Baker, who had begun blackmailing Orwell over the picture; and Louise Carpenter, who knew Restarick too well to be fooled by Orwell. The murder plot involved killing both of them, and convincing Norma that she was the killer. They used harsh drugs to make her doubt her memory, and led Norma to believe she did the deeds herself. Norma had never in reality been in Louiseâ€™s flat: they simply switched the 7 and the 6 on the door of her own flat. All along the â€œthird girlâ€� in the flat on whom attention should have been focused has been not Norma, but Frances.
At the end of the novel Norma agreed to marry Dr. Stillingfleet (a young psychiatrist) and move to Australia. He had staunchly defended Normaâ€™s innocence even when it was most in question. Norma inherited the vast fortune of Restarick. Mrs. Oliver realized that Poirot planned this happy ending all along. Finally Poirot hinted to Sonia that he knew of her espionage activities and she abandoned them in order to marry Sir Roderick.

Major themes
This novel is notable for its overt use of coincidence, such as Mrs Oliver going into a cafÃ© that happens to contain the girl she is seeking, and having a key piece of evidence literally fall into her hands from a drawer as furniture is being removed from a dead woman's flat. This very obvious use of coincidence is known as open authorial manipulation and is often used to draw the reader's attention to the artificiality of the plot. It is highly appropriate to a detective novel in which a central character writes detective fiction and is an example of metafiction .
Literary significance and reception
Unusually for this period, The Guardian didn't carry a review of the novel.
Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 13 November 1966 concluded, "There is the usual double-take surprise solution centring round a perhaps rather artificial identity problem; but the suspense holds up all the way. Dialogue and characters are lively as flies. After this, I shan't be a bit surprised to see A.C. wearing a mini-skirt ." [4]
Robert Barnard : "One of Christie's more embarrassing attempts to haul herself abreast of the swinging 'sixties. Mrs Oliver plays a large part, detection a small one." [5]
References to other works
The novel reintroduces Stillingfleet, a character from the short story The Dream and first published in book form in the UK in The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding in 1960, and Mr Goby, whose previous appearance had been in After the Funeral in 1953.
Film, TV or theatrical adaptations
A TV adaptation by Peter Flannery for the series Agatha Christie's Poirot starring David Suchet as Poirot and ZoÃ« Wanamaker as Ariadne Oliver was filmed in April and May 2008. It aired on 28 September of the same year on ITV , except for the STV Region which for some unexplained reason has refused point blank to show the final Poirot case at all (despite it showing the other 2 cases). The adaptation takes huge liberties with the novel, these including:
Moving the 1960s setting to the 1930s, in accordance with the other episodes in the series.
Omitting the characters of Dr Stillingfleet and Miss Lemon.
Omitting the subterfuge of Mary Restarick posing as Frances Cary. Instead, Mary Restarick is made to be Norma's mother, who committed suicide by slitting her wrists when Norma was a little child.
Replacing the character of Louise Charpentier with a new character, Lavinia Seagram, who becomes Norma's nanny. She is murdered in exactly the same way Mary Restarick committed suicide, instead of being pushed out of a window like Louise Charpentier in the novel. The motive of her murder remains the same as Louise's in the novel â€“ she is killed because she threatened to reveal the true identity of Robert Orwell, the man posing as Andrew Restarick.
Having Frances Cary become the half-sister to Norma. Norma's old teacher, Miss Battersby, had had an affair with Andrew Restarick and bore Frances. When Miss Battersby learned of Robert Orwell and his deception, she told her daughter, who found a way to become Orwell's co-conspirator. Frances tried to get Norma hanged for a crime that she never committed to inherit her half-sister's fortune.
Having Norma's disoriented state being blamed on the trauma caused by her mother's suicide. She is never given drugs as in the novel. Her fragile mind is manipulated by Frances, who planted a knife in her room before Norma discovered Nanny Seagram's body, and then removed it afterwards. This made Norma believe that she had committed the murder.
The character of David Baker being spared at the end, unlike in the novel, in which he was murdered. In the adaptation, he serves as Norma's love interest, whereas in the novel, Norma's love interest is Dr. Stillingfleet.
Ariadne Oliver's book Lady Don't Fall Backwards â€“ this is a shout-out to the Hancock's Half Hour TV episode "The Missing Page", in which Tony Hancock tries to find out who committed the murder in a book he'd just read with a missing page (mirrored by the concierge, Alf Renny, who tells Mrs Oliver that he'd read her book four times and still had no idea who did it).
