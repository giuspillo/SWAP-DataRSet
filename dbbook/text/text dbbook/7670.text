(July 2010)
At Shrewsbury Abbey , the heavy snowfall in mid-December 1142 causes severe damage to the slate tile roof of the guest hall. Each monk takes a share of the work under the guidance of their master builder Brother Conradin. Cadfael took his turn. Brother Haluin puts in his stint, falling down 40 feet along with many broken slate tiles. His prospects for survival are small.
At the abbey's infirmary, he confesses to Abbot Radulfus and Brother Cadfael. At the age of eighteen, Haluin fell in love with Bertrade de Clary. Despite his own good background and their mutual love, Bertrade's mother Adelais forbade his suit. The heartbroken Haluin entered the monastery, only to be visited there by Adelais asking for herbs that would end Bertrade's pregnancy. Adelais later told him that Bertrade and the unborn child died from the herbs he had sent, while she told others her daughter died of fever to hide the shame. He begs Cadfael to forgive him for the misuse of his herbs, and asks the abbot to forgive his sins and to grant him absolution. Haluin is much relieved before his expected death.
But Haluin lives. He struggles to walk with crutches and specially made shoes. Cadfael asks Hugh Beringar if the wife of de Clary yet lived. She lives at Hales, while her son Audemar, sworn to King Stephen, resides in Staffordshire. In early March Haluin asks to make a pilgrimage for penance. His vow burns in him: a pilgrimage on foot to Bertrade's mother and to Bertrade's tomb at Hales , east of Shrewsbury. Haluin may go, if he takes Brother Cadfael with him.
On 4 March, they begin the three-day journey to Hales. They meet with Adelais, who offers the forgiveness Haluin begs. Bertrade is not buried at the church. They learn that the family tomb is at Elford in Staffordshire. Their trip to Elford (via Watling Street and Lichfield ) takes the better part of a week. Haluin and Cadfael arrive at Elford to find Adelais in the church, kneeling before the tomb, as if she is their shadow. Adelais shelters them in her dower house , keeping them from her son's household. Haluin spends the cold night on his knees, alongside Cadfael at the de Clary tomb. At sunrise, a curious Roscelin arrives at the church timely to assist Cadfael in bringing Haluin to his feet. Roscelin says he was sent away by his father to serve Audemar, their friend and overlord. Lothair, bringing food, sends the young man away.
Starting home, a sudden snowstorm forces them to seek shelter at the manor of Vivers. Cenred, the lord of the manor, learns that Haluin is an ordained priest. He asks Haluin to officiate at the wedding of his much younger half-sister, Helisende, to a nobleman on the morrow. His own son, who was raised with Helisende, has fallen in love with the girl. Such a relationship is prohibited. Haluin agrees. Cadfael meets Helisende about the manor, who says that she agrees to this marriage freely. Edgytha serves Haluin and Cadfael their midday meal. Helisende is the daughter of her late master with his second, much younger wife, who is in the convent at Polesworth since he died about eight years before. Cadfael mentions that Adelais is at Elford.
Jean de Perronet, charming and very happy, arrives. Cadfael and Haluin take supper in the hall with the family. Lady Emma reports that Edgytha is gone. She told a servant she would be back quickly, with a cat to put among the pigeons. This alarms the family, and Cadfael. Cenred organises a search party.
Edgytha's body is found, knife wound to her chest and nothing stolen, clearly murdered. Cenred sends word ahead to Elford with this news. Cadfael sees snow beneath her body, not atop it, suggesting she was on her way home from Elford. The entire household gathers in the hall at Vivers, save one: Helisende. Jean de Perronet suspects the planned marriage is linked to this death. Roscelin Vivers arrives home, angry at what his father has done behind his back. Roscelin did not see Edgytha at Elford. Helisende is not there to speak for herself. Audemar arrives, taking charge.
With no bride there is no marriage. Haluin sees how small his own problems are. Cadfael and Haluin leave on a new path bypassing Lichfield. As evening nears, they approach the new Benedictine convent at Farewell planned by Bishop Roger de Clinton . [1] They sleep there. Next morning, Haluin recognises Bertrade, the girl he loved and thought he had killed, and she recognises him. She is Sister Benedicta, sent from Polesworth to help this new place. Cadfael negotiates an hour's meeting between Brother Haluin and Sister Benedicta with Mother Patrice, who has informed the family that Helisende is safe with them.
Cadfael rides to Elford. He challenges Adelais with what she had done to Haluin and to her own daughter. Adelais married Bertrade off to Cenred's father Edric while Bertrade was with child by another man. She confesses that she begged the herbs from Haluin then lied about her daughter's death to Haluin to torment him. Her anger rose because Haluin had fallen in love with her daughter and not her. If she could not have Haluin, then no woman could. Edgytha, part of Adelais's household back then, knew the truth of Helisende. Edgytha ran to Adelais, who refused leave for the truth to be told. Adelais claims all the guilt, including sending her grooms away, who most likely murdered Edgytha. She must tell Cenred that Helisende is not his half-sister; it is already coming out at Farewell. She agrees.
At Vivers manor, Audemar de Clary, the Vivers and de Perronet learn that Helisende is not blood kin to Roscelin. Adelais admits to her foul deeds long ago. They realise Edgytha knew as well. She tells them that Betrade, Helisende and Helisende's father have met at Farewell. The father was a clerk in her household, a year older than her daughter. Cadfael attests to the meeting, telling Haluin's tale in so doing. This stunning news is hard for the Vivers family to accept, a shock to Audemar, a challenge to de Perronet. Helisende is still loved by the Vivers, blood kin or not. Adelais has lands to leave her granddaughter. Roscelin is joyous. Audemar claims Helisende as his niece, and as overlord places his niece with Cenred once she is ready to leave Farewell. He and Roscelin ride back with Adelais. Audemar banishes his mother to Hales. Cadfael returns to Farewell
Haluin shares his joy of meeting Bertrade and Helisende with Cadfael. Haluin is satisfied with his present blessings, this season of his love. He has no angry words for Adelais. The two Benedictine brothers walk home to Shrewsbury in completion of the vow, the truth having changed so much.

Themes and Setting in History
The importance of the truth is a major theme in this novel. The use of power over others for one's own ends and the damage it can do, and of course, the power of confession are at the heart of the plot.
The story begins at the moment when King Stephen loses his advantage over the competing claimant for the crown he wears when Empress Maud takes advantage of the cold and snowy weather to escape the siege. It was a dramatic event, amazing given the presence of the King and his army besieging the town for months, hardly any food left for them. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The month before it looked a desperate situation for the Empress, then the tables turned in a spate of bad weather. Why the King did not move in on her when he had her trapped is for speculation. Was it his nature not to put a woman in chains? Was he ever optimistic that she would surrender?
As remarked by the characters in the novel, it is as if the years of warring factions, since Empress Maud came from Normandy and Anjou to Arundel and began the confrontation, begin anew when they might have ended with a clear-cut victory.
The move by her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester , to bring her son to England was in retrospect the wisest move for the Empress's long term power. [11] Young Henry Plantagenet became King Henry II on the death of King Stephen. Though his mother, King Stephen and he were all descendants of William the Conqueror , the English dynasties are named for the father. Thus Henry was the first Angevin king in England, beginning 331 years of rule by the House of Plantagenet , though his father Geoffrey of Anjou never stepped foot in England.
That jolting escape in the snowstorm occurred about the same time as Brother Haluin makes the startling deathbed confession of his youthful sins, never before confessed. When he survives his injuries, he makes a pilgrimage seeking forgiveness from the one person he thinks is the only survivor offended by his sin. He learns that part of his confessed acts never happened; his actions never led to anyone's death.
His choice of penance, a pilgrimage to the place where he did what needed atoning, was very much of the times, of the 12th century in Christian England. [12] [13]
The places named in the novel are real, including Shrewsbury , Shrewsbury Abbey , Hales , Lichfield , Elford , the Priory at Farewell [14] [15] under construction by Bishop Roger de Clinton (temporary wooden structures being built in stone), and every stop along the way with a place name, including crossing the River Tame shortly before arriving in the village of Elford.
The story is set in the era of feudalism and the manorial system . The other significant aspect of life was the ongoing Crusades to the Holy Land. [16] [17] [18] Bertrand de Clary felt the call to the Crusades once his two children were born, leaving his wife more power than she might otherwise have exerted on her seventeen year old daughter. Young men in their teens often travelled to another manor to learn military skills ( squires [19] ), or in the case of Haluin, clerk duties. Adelais de Clary used her power to ruin her daughter's life, and tried to do the same to the handsome young man who had been living at her manor for four years.
As she admitted to Brother Cadfael in a shocking confession:
â€œToo comely!â€� she said. â€œI was not used to being denied, I did not even know how to sue. And he was too innocent to read me aright. How such children offend without offense! So if I could not have him,â€� she said starkly, â€œshe should not. No woman ever should, but not she of all women.â€� [20]
She wanted him for her young lover, [20] he wanted to marry her daughter and her daughter wanted to marry him. The young people were blissfully unaware of the mother's strong desires and equally strong dislike of being refused or denied what she wanted. In the presence of the father, the young lovers might well have had their way and married. Instead, in this system where women in general had little power, she works an astounding amount of evil actions on the two young people in her home, also deceiving another family and her son who is working in place of his father. The full truth is known only to her until the chance event of Haluin surviving a disastrous fall, seeking her out. He and her daughter made reasonably good lives despite her, but Haluin had internalised great sufferings for 18 years before he could release his memories of intense youthful love, see his daughter full grown (as Cadfael had first seen his son) and open his eyes to the suffering of others.
Reviews and Critical Reception
Kirkus Reviews says
A new adventure for canny, urbane Brother Cadfael, herbalist monk at Shrewsbury's Benedictine Abbey in 1142, that provides more romance than detection. Brother Haluin, the Abbey's gifted illustrator, has suffered a near-fatal accident and, in what seems to be a deathbed confession, tells of his love 20 years ago for Bertrade, daughter of Adelais de Clary of Hales. His plea for marriage denied, Haluin entered the monastery, then learned from Adelais that Bertrade was pregnant. He gave her herbs from Cadfael's store for an abortion and was later told. by Adelais that both Bertrade and the child were dead. Following this confession, however, Haluin does not die. Crippled and on crutches, with Cadfael at his side, he sets out on a pilgrimage to Bertrade's tomb to make a nightlong vigil of atonement. The two make their tortuous way to Halesâ€”with Cadfael witnessing another seemingly doomed love affair; delving into old mysteries; solving a new one for his own satisfaction; righting old wrongs, and changing some lives forever. As always with Peters, an absorbing passage to another world, but this one lacks some of the swift pacing, tension, and excitement of her best work (The Rose Rent, etc.). Nevertheless, a must for fansâ€”and refreshment for all.
Pub Date: Jan. 9th, 1988
Publisher: Mysterious Pressâ€”dist. by Ballantine [21]
Publishers Weekly says
It is up to Brother Cadfael to untangle the threads that bind the past to the present to avert another tragedy. Though the plot is somewhat obvious, Peters knows her period well and does not strike one false note in this thoroughly entertaining medieval mystery. (Jan.) [22]
Library Journal says of the audio book
Eventually, he and Cadfael embark on a penitential journey to Hales, where they find answers to old and new mysteries alike in this wonderful novel of love and redemption. Stephen Thorne is one of the truly great readers; his ability to render perfectly the medieval world of Cadfael's Shrewsbury makes this an essential purchase for libraries. Fans of the series will enjoy this 15th entry of the "Chronicles."-Barbara A. Perkins, Irving P.L., TX Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information. [22]
Also reviewing the 1998 audio book, AudioFile [23] [note 1] says
Altogether a good bet. Peters is the master of the medieval mystery, and any time spent with Stephen Thorne is time well spent. D.G. (c) AudioFile 2002, Portland, Maine [Published: AUG/SEP 02] [24]
Stephen Knapp makes a concise point about the 12th century world depicted in this novel, a major difference from the present day. The novel takes "a satisfying journey through mid 12th century England and warm feeling for the comfort and security the people of that time had for an all-knowing and benevolent God." [25]
