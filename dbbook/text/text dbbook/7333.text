Fablehaven is The New York Times' best-selling children's literature fantasy series written by Brandon Mull. The book series, which includes Fablehaven, Fablehaven: Rise of the Evening Star, Fablehaven: Grip of the Shadow Plague, Fablehaven: Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary, and Fablehaven: Keys to the Demon Prison, is published by Shadow Mountain in hardcover and Simon & Schuster in paperback.
Fablehaven
The story begins with Kendra and Seth visiting their grandparents in Connecticut while their parents take a 17 day cruise. At first the siblings entertain themselves with an attic full of interesting books and toys, and a pond-like swimming pool surrounded by hummingbirds, brightly colored-butterflies and exotic dragonflies. But soon their attentions wander to the forbidden forest that surrounds their grandparent's house. When Kendra discovers a book entitled Journal of Secrets and follows the directions to "Drink the milk" a whole new hidden and amazing world is revealed to the siblings at Fablehaven. Kendra and Seth find out quickly how dangerous this new magical environment is when rules are broken, thrusting them into the middle of a fight for their lives, and their family.
Fablehaven: Rise of the Evening Star
The second book returns us to the Sorenson siblings the following year, where a strange new student has infiltrated the school in disguise, causing mischief and Kendra is the only one who can see the charade. The Society of the Evening Star, an ancient organization determined to overthrow magical preserves and use them for their own intents and purposes, is on the move and is determined to infiltrate Fablehaven. New characters are introduced who mentor Kendra and Seth with their knowledge of magical potions, animals, and items. In addition, these three specialists have a more perilous assignmentâ€”find an artifact of great power hidden on the grounds. When the Evening Star pervades the gates of Fablehaven, it is assumed that someone inside the preserve is a traitor. If the artifact falls into the wrong hands, it could mean the downfall of other preserves and possibly the world. Kendra and Seth are both wrapped in the middle when they are the only ones able to help.
Fablehaven: Grip of the Shadow Plague
The third book starts where the second book ended, during the same summer of their second year at Fablehaven. Seth discovers that someone, or something, has released a plague that transforms beings of light into creatures of darkness. For the first time, some of the main characters visit another magical reserve, as another hidden artifact must be recovered from Lost Mesa in Arizona. New characters are introduced and new magical creatures of light and darkness are confronted, and hard sacrifices made.
Fablehaven: Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary
Things are heating up between the Knights of the Dawn and the Society of the Evening Star, who turn to kidnapping Kendra in an attempt to discover secrets. The race to obtain the 5 magical artifacts continues, and leads the Knights, and the Sorensons, to a deadly dragon Sanctuary called Wyrmroost. They face bigger challenges than they've ever faced before, including negotiating with a wizard, an enormous evil dragon, and the biggest giant in the world.
Fablehaven: Keys to the Demon Prison
The final book in the series has the Sorenson siblings traveling to different preserves around the earth in the attempt to secure the remaining magical artifacts before the Society gets them. A powerful new ally joins the fight, but deadly new enemies also add to the escalation. The conflict separates Kendra and Seth who take on different missions, each extremely dangerous and exciting. They finally reunite just before the confrontation at Zzyzx, and the opening of the demon prison. An unexpected event orchestrated by the Fairy Queen was their only hope to save the world.
Reception
The series has enjoyed positive reviews by critics. With the release of the third book, the series was awarded a spot on the New York Times top ten best selling children's series list. With the release of the fifth book, the series reached as high as 4th on the list. [2]
Obert Skye , the author of Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo - "Imagination runs wild in Fablehaven. It is a lucky book that can hold this kind of story." [3]
The New York Times - "Mullâ€™s awkward writing sometimes underscores the overfamiliar plot mechanics of the two-children-save-the-world fantasy, but his story offers unexpected twists and entertainingly scary creatures." [4]
Columbia Daily Tribune - "This story is so compelling and so well written youâ€™ll find its magic working on you as well, completely taking over your ability to put the book down, even for a moment. Mull has an extraordinary writing ability." [5]
Orson Scott Card - "At first glance, Fablehaven looks like a book for kids; but, like Harry Potter, Fablehaven can be read aloud in a family with as much pleasure for grownups as for children. And solitary adults who pick it up for their own enjoyment will be well rewarded. Do yourself a favor, and don't miss the first novel by a writer who is clearly going to be a major figure in popular fantasy." [6]
Christopher Paolini , author of Eragon said, "The Fablehaven books are so entertaining that I read the first three in a single sitting. They kept me turning the pages until 4:40 in the morning. Each book was better than the last! Brandon Mull is a talented new fantasy writer, and I can't wait to read more from him. The world he has created is deep, intriguing, magical, and full of surprising discoveries and unexpected dangers. I especially liked his two main characters, Kendra and Seth. They both act like real people, and unlike many fictional siblings, they help and support each other when they're in trouble. The Fablehaven series is one of the most enjoyable fantasies I've read in the past few years. I only wish I could have read it when I was ten or twelve." [7]
BookReview.com - "Where have all the fairies gone? To Fablehaven of course! A preserve for magical creatures awaits your visit in Brandon Mullâ€™s fantastical, wonderful book, â€œFablehaven.â€� Look out J.K. Rowling ; the fantasy genre has an outstanding new author to embrace!" [8]
