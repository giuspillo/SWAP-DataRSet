Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy is a historical study of the different forms of shamanism around the world written by the Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade. It was first published in France by Librarie Payot under the French title of Le Chamanisme et les techniques archaïques de l'extase in 1951. The book was subsequently translated into English by Willard R. Trask and published by Princeton University Press in 1964. At the time of the book's writing, Eliade had earned a PhD studying Hinduism in India before becoming involved with far right politics in his native Romania. After the rise of the far left communist government, he fled to Paris, France in 1945, where he took up an academic position and began studying shamanism, authoring several academic papers on the subject before publishing his book. The first half of Shamanism deals with the various different elements of shamanic practice, such as the nature of initiatory sickness and dreams, the method for obtaining shamanic powers, the role of shamanic initiation and the symbolism of the shaman's costume and drum. The book's second half looks at the development of shamanism in each region of the world where it is found, including Central and North Asia, the Americas, Southeastern Asia and Oceania and also Tibet, China and the Far East. Eliade argues that all of these shamanisms must have had a common source as the original religion of humanity in the Palaeolithic. On publication, Eliade's book was recognised as a seminal and authoritative study on the subject of shamanism. In later decades, as anthropological and historical scholarship increased and improved, elements of the book came under increasing scrutiny, as did Eliade's argument that there was a global phenomenon that could be termed "shamanism" or that all shamanisms had a common source. His book also proved to be a significant influence over the Neoshamanic movement which developed in the western world in the 1960s and 1970s.
Background
Mircea Eliade was born in Bucharest , Romania in 1907. Attending the Spiru Haret National College, he subsequently studied at the University of Bucharest 's Faculty of Philosophy and Letters from 1925 through to 1928. Traveling to India to study the country's religions, in 1933 he received his PhD for a thesis devoted to a discussion of Yoga . Writing for the nationalist newspaper CuvÃ¢ntul , he spoke out against antisemitism but became associated with the Iron Guard , a Romanian fascist group. Arrested for his involvement in the far right , following his release in 1940 he gained employment as a cultural attachÃ© to both the United Kingdom and then Portugal. Following the Second World War , Eliade moved to Paris , France, fearing the rise of a communist government in Romania . Here, he married for a second time, to the Romanian exile Christinel Cotescu. [1]
Together with Emil Cioran and other Romanian expatriates, Eliade rallied with the former diplomat Alexandru Busuioceanu , helping him publicize anti-communist opinion to the Western European public. [2] In 1947, he was facing material constraints, and Ananda Coomaraswamy found him a job as a French-language teacher in the United States, at a school in Arizona ; the arrangement ended upon Coomaraswamy's death in September. [3] Beginning in 1948, he wrote for the journal Critique, edited by French thinker Georges Bataille . [4] The following year, he went on a visit to Italy, where he wrote the first 300 pages of his novel Noaptea de SÃ¢nziene (he visited the country a third time in 1952). [4] He collaborated with Carl Jung and the Eranos circle after Henry Corbin recommended him in 1949, [3] and wrote for the Antaios magazine (edited by Ernst JÃ¼nger ). [5] In 1950, Eliade began attending Eranos conferences, meeting Jung, Olga FrÃ¶be-Kapteyn , Gershom Scholem and Paul Radin . [6] He described Eranos as "one of the most creative cultural experiences of the modern Western world." [7]
Working from France, Eliade had begun to study shamanism from a global perspective, publishing three papers on the subject: "Le ProblÃ©me du chamanisme" in the Revue de l'histoire des religions journal (1946), "Shamanism" in Forgotten Religions, an anthology edited by Vergilius Ferm (1949), and "EinfÃ¼hrende Betrachtungen Ã¼ber den Schamanismus" in the Paideuma journal (1951). He had also lectured on the subject in March 1950 at both the University of Rome and the Instituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente . [8]

"To the best of our knowledge the present book is the first to cover the entire phenomenon of shamanism and at the same time to situate it in the general history of religion. To say this is to imply its liability to imperfection and approximation and the risks that it takes."
Mircea Eliade, 1951. [9]
In his foreword, Eliade explains the approach that he has taken in the book, noting that his intention is to situate world shamanism within the larger history of religion . Disputing any claims that shamanism is a result of mental illness, he highlights the benefits that further sociological and ethnographic research could provide before explaining the role of a historian of religions. Describing shamanism as "precisely one of the archaic techniques of ecstasy", he proclaims that it is "at once mysticism , magic and "religion" in the broadest sense of the term." [10]
Chapter one, "General Considerations. Recruiting Methods. Shamanism and Mystical Vocation", details Eliade's exploration of the etymology and terminological usage of the word "shamanism". [11]
Arguments
Definition of "shamanism"
Within his study of the subject, Eliade proposed several different definitions of the word "shamanism". The first of these was that shamanism simply constituted a "technique of ecstasy", and in Eliade's opinion, this was the "least hazardous" definition. [12]
