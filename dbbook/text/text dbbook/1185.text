Synopsis
In a psychiatric clinic late one night, the piercing scream of a dying woman shatters the calm, and Detective Superintendent Dalgliesh is called away from his literary soiree to investigate.

With discernment, depth and craftsmanship, A Mind to Murder is a superbly satisfying mystery. - Chicago Daily News [2]
