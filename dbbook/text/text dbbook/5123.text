The title of the book comes from a peculiar chariot race in Rome on the Ides of October, after which the right-hand horse of the winning team was sacrificed to the Roman gods. Then two teams, one from the Subura and the other from the Via Sacra , competed for the Horse's head. Julius Caesar , figuratively the best war horse in Rome, represents the October Horse in this novel.
