Infinity and the Mind: The Science and Philosophy of the Infinite is a theoretical mathematics book by American mathematician, computer scientist, and science fiction writer Rudy Rucker.

The dust jacket of the original (BirkhÃ¤user) edition had a picture of a star over a mountain and appeared to be a religious or mystical work. Subsequent paperback reprintings had covers suggesting that the publishers wished to appeal to a "new age" market. The most recent editions, from Princeton University Press , have very austere covers suggesting an academic work.
Synopsis
The book contains popular expositions (accessible to readers with no more than a high school mathematics background) on the mathematical theory of infinity , and a number of related topics. These include GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems and their relationship to concepts of artificial intelligence and the human mind, as well as the conceivability of some unconventional cosmological models. The material is approached from a variety of viewpoints, some more conventionally mathematical and others being nearly mystical. There is a brief account of the author's personal contact with Kurt GÃ¶del .
An appendix contains one of the few popular expositions on set theory research on what are known as "strong axioms of infinity."
