Reception
Gerry Feehily reviewed the book for The Independent , and saw a parallel between its themes and those in Candide by Voltaire : "But Voltaire was pulling our leg. Candide is a starry-eyed idiot whose idealism is dashed to bits by the horrors of absolutist Europe. His resignation is inevitable. With Gavalda, resignation, a longing for stasis, is a virtue. That she has a worldwide audience suggests she has tapped into a mood which many people share." [1]
