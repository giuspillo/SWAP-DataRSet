It blamed the local Kosovo Albanians for sodomizing Ä�orÄ‘e MartinoviÄ‡ , and published fabricated reader letters claiming that the Albanians were "raping hundreds of Serbian women". Before and during the Croatian War of Independence , it published opinions on how "blood may shed again" in Croatia because of World War II, published false claims on how the Vatican funded Croatia to break up Yugoslavia, etc. At the end of the Battle of Vukovar , it ran the fabricated story of the Vukovar children massacre .
