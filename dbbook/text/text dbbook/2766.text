Plot summary
The novel tells the story of Eamon Redmond, a judge in the Irish High Court of the late twentieth century Ireland. It reconstructs his relationships with his wife and children through his life and the memories of a childhood marked by the death of his father. The County Wexford landscape and the death of the father are the narrative material, which Colm TÃ³ibÃ­n would revisit again in the The Blackwater Lightship .
The novel takes its title from a line from the song " Boolavogue ", specifically "a rebel hand set the heather blazing".

It has been said that this novel made TÃ³ibÃ­n the heir of John McGahern . Amongst Women, a book by McGahern, has similar atmosphere to this book.
