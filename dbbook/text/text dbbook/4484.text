This magazine has been published continuously since 1879 and is nonpolitical. It adheres to the Bible as its authority.
Content
The Watchtower is the primary means of spreading the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses, and includes articles relating to Bible prophecy, Christian conduct and morals, as well as the history of religion and the Bible.
The Witnesses' worldwide "Field Service" report appeared each year in the January 1 issue of The Watchtower from 1882 until 2004, and in the February 1 issue from 2005 to 2007. As of 2008, the "Field Service" report does not appear in The Watchtower but continues to appear in the annual Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses., [10] and on the official website. [11] [12]
Previously, each issue of the Watchtower contained study articles and other regular features and was distributed to the general public. As of 2008, two editions of The Watchtower are produced each month. The issue dated the 1st of each month is distributed to the public and is referred to as the Public Edition. The subjects covered in the issue as well as the style of writing are intended to appeal to non-Witnesses. The issue dated the 15th, called the Study Edition, contains "pointed information prepared especially for Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses" and is generally distributed only to members but is made available to members of the public attending the study of The Watchtower at congregation meetings. [13] [14]

Study Edition
The Study Edition contains study articles written for the Watchtower Study, as well as other intra-organizational information directed to current and prospective members. [15]
Congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide discuss the same article each week at the Watchtower Study. In this meeting, each paragraph is read aloud by a designated reader, after which the conductor asks the question printed at the bottom of the page for that paragraph; members of the congregation are then called upon to answer the questions based on the printed information. They are encouraged to put the information in their own words and to "draw attention to scripture application, supporting arguments, or practical application of the material." [16]
Many study articles in The Watchtower are based on outlines from discourses presented at District Conventions of Jehovah's Witnesses. [17] [18]
Other regular sections of the Study Edition are:
Cover art, (monthly, from January 2012) a picture of Jehovah's Witnesses preaching, with the original photograph on page 2 and facts about the preaching work in the nation depicted; [19]
From Our Archives (semi-regularly, from January 2012), an article about the organization's history;
Questions From Readers (semi-regularly), a consideration of a doctrinal question based on a specific scripture;
Do You Remember? (three times each year), a brief summary of points from recent issues of the magazine.
The November issue of each year contains an article outlining the various ways that donations can be made to support the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses.
Authorship
The Writing Committee of the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses oversees the research, editing, and development of the articles. The articles are mostly contributed by writing committees from worldwide branch offices, which are then checked by editors and translated into the languages of publication; all involved are volunteers. [20] Women are permitted to write articles that are not of a doctrinal nature. [21] The names of the authors (except in first-person life stories), and other publishing staff are never included in the magazine. All articles are produced under the authority and supervision of the Governing Body; the content is therefore considered the official teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses. [22]
Distribution
Since the first issue of The Watchtower in 1879, with 6,000 copies printed, circulation of The Watchtower continued to increase, and the magazine has not missed an issue. [23] The magazine is printed in nineteen different countries; [24] about 25% of the total is printed at one of the organization's printeries in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
The monthly Public Edition has an average print run of about 46,000,000 copies, making it the magazine with the largest circulation in the world. [4] The print run of the monthly Study Edition is not stated in the English edition; the Russian edition states a print run of over 14,000,000.
The magazine is distributed by Jehovah's Witnesses, who consider their preaching work to be a public service . Witnesses commonly offer these magazines in the course of their house-to-house ministry. They are also distributed by approaching people in public places, or given informally to doctors, academics, politicians and acquaintances. The Watchtower may also be seen left as reading material in public places, including bus terminals, or laundromats . The Watch Tower Society advises against distribution practices such as mailbox drops and placing large stacks in public places, which they consider to be less effective methods of arousing interest compared to personal presentation of the literature. [25]

Cost
Until March 1990, The Watchtower and its companion Awake! were available for a small charge that varied over time and in different countries. For example, in the United States, the suggested donation per issue was $0.05 in 1950, [30] gradually increasing to $0.25 in 1989. [31] On January 17, 1990, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that sales of religious literature were subject to taxation, [32] which introduced ambiguity into the formerly tax-free practice of suggesting a specific amount in exchange for the magazines. The Watch Tower Society filed an amicus curiae ("friend of the court") brief arguing that the perceived sale of religious literature should be exempt from taxation. [33] From March 1, 1990, the journals were made available at no cost, on a freewill donation basis in the United States, with the stated purpose of simplifying their Bible educational work and distinguishing themselves from those who commercialize religion. [34] The article "Use Our Literature Wisely", which appeared in the May 1990 issue of Our Kingdom Ministry , stated that "there are growing pressures against all religious elements" and went on to say that their main concern was to move ahead in the worldwide preaching work, "without hindrance."
The sale of Jehovah's Witnesses' literature was gradually phased out in other countries, and The Watchtower has been distributed free of charge worldwide since January 2000, its printing being funded by voluntary donations from Jehovah's Witnesses and members of the public. [35]
