According to an author interview, Jeff Kinney said of the origin of Diary of a Wimpy Kid, "I wanted to write a story about the funny parts of growing up and none of the serious parts. I had a pretty ordinary childhood, but lots of humorous stuff happened along the way. So, I decided to write a book about what it was really like to be a kid, or at least what it was like for me."
