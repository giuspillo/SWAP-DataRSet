The Snowy Day is a 1962 children's picture book by American author and illustrator Ezra Jack Keats. Keats received the 1963 Caldecott Medal for his illustrations in the book. It features a boy named Peter exploring his neighborhood after the first snowfall of the season. The inspiration for Peter came from a Life magazine photo article from 1940, and Keats' desire to have minority children of New York as central characters in his stories. Peter appears in six more books growing from a small boy in The Snowy Day to pre-adolescence in A Letter to Amy.
Development
After serving in World War II, Keats returned to New York and started a career in illustration, working first in the comic industry, and then working for such publications as Readerâ€™s Digest, The New York Times Book Review, and Collierâ€™s. In the 1950s Keats started illustrating dust jackets, and when one book cover caught the eye of an editor of youth literature, Keats was soon commissioned to illustrate childrenâ€™s books.
Keats started solely as an illustrator for the work of other authors. But he soon observed that few children's books showcased an African-American or other minority child as the main character. Published in 1962, The Snowy Day was the first book Keats both authored and illustrated, and was a milestone for featuring the first African-American protagonist in a full-color picture book. â€œNone of the manuscripts Iâ€™d been illustrating featured any black kidsâ€”except for token blacks in the background. My book would have him there simply because he should have been there all along,â€� Keats wrote in an unpublished autobiography (portions of which have been printed in various publications since the authorâ€™s death). [3]
Peter in The Snowy Day was inspired by a strip of photographs of an African-American boy that Keats had clipped from a May 1940 issue of Life magazine. â€œYears ago, long before I ever thought of doing childrenâ€™s books, while looking through a magazine I came across four candid photos of a little boy about three or four years old,â€� said Keats in his acceptance speech for the Caldecott Medal, the most prestigious award in childrenâ€™s literature, which he won for The Snowy Day in 1963. â€œHis expressive face, his body attitudes, the very way he wore his clothes, totally captivated meâ€¦ As the years went by, these pictures would find their way back to my walls, offering me fresh pleasure at each encounter. In more recent years, while illustrating childrenâ€™s books, the desire to do my own story about this little boy began to germinate. Up he went againâ€”this time above my drawing table. He was my model and inspiration.â€� [4]
The source for the storyline, Keats noted, came from his memories of snowy days in his Brooklyn childhood. Above all, Keats wanted to capture the wonderment of a childâ€™s first snowfall, a feeling universal to all children, regardless of race. â€œI wanted to convey the joy of being a little boy alive on a certain kind of dayâ€”of being for that moment. The air is cold, you touch the snow, aware of the things to which all children are so open.â€� [5]
The Snowy Day was immediately welcomed by educators and critics and embraced by the public. The book is noteworthy not only as a benchmark in racial representation in literature, but also for the simplicity and elegance of the writing, which many be attributed to Keatsâ€™s love of haiku poetry. The beautiful illustrations also marked the book as a great accomplishment of art in a childrenâ€™s book. Keats, who was a painter first and foremost, chose to illustrate the book with collage, a medium he had never used before. â€œThe idea of using collage came to me at the same time I was thinking about the story. I used a bit of paper here and there and immediately saw new colors, patterns, and relationships forming.â€� [6]
Critical Reception
As the civil-rights movement entered a new phase of black cultural consciousness in the mid- to late-1960s, The Snowy Day began to meet with some criticism. â€œAfter The Snowy Day was published, many, many people thought I was black,â€� said Keats. â€œAs a matter of fact, many were disappointed that I wasnâ€™t!â€� [6] A 1965 Saturday Review article, â€œThe All-White World of Childrenâ€™s Books,â€� criticized Keats for not addressing Peterâ€™s race in the text. In the 1970s, some critics argued that The Snowy Day was too integrationist, and did not truly represent or celebrate African-American cultural or racial identity. By the 1980s the cultural landscape had shifted again. â€œHow many literary light years separate Little Black Sambo from The Snowy Day?â€� a critic wrote. â€œAlthough we have been led to believe by twenty years of reporting that Keatsâ€™s work was special because of his use of collage, it is his vision of the universal human spirit as personified in one pre-school black youngster that marks this book for attention.â€� [7]
Throughout these debates, The Snowy Day has remained a deeply loved and profoundly influential book. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named the book one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children." [8] It was #5 on a list of "Top 100 Picture Books" of all time in a 2012 poll by School Library Journal . [9]
