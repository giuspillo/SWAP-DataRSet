Homicide Trinity is a collection of Nero Wolfe mystery novellas by Rex Stout, published by the Viking Press in 1962. The book comprises three stories: "Eeny Meeny Murder Mo," first published in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine #220 (March 1962) "Death of a Demon," first serialized in three issues of The Saturday Evening Post (June 10, 17 and 24, 1961) "Counterfeit for Murder," first serialized as "The Counterfeiter's Knife" in three issues of The Saturday Evening Post (January 14, 21 and 28, 1961) Over the years I have been suspected of a lot of things by various authorities, from corrupting a cop by buying him a drink to complicity in a murder, and that day they added a new one to the list. None of them came right out with it, but what was really biting them was their suspicion that I was in collusion with the United States government. — Archie, contemplating a turf battle between the police and the Treasury Department, in "Counterfeit for Murder," chapter 8
" Death of a Demon ", first serialized in three issues of The Saturday Evening Post (June 10, 17 and 24, 1961)

The far less valuable Viking book club edition may be distinguished from the first edition in three ways:
The dust jacket has "Book Club Edition" printed on the inside front flap, and the price is absent (first editions may be price clipped if they were given as gifts).
Book club editions are sometimes thinner and always taller (usually a quarter of an inch) than first editions.
Book club editions are bound in cardboard, and first editions are bound in cloth (or have at least a cloth spine). [4]
