‘Art’ is a French language play by Yasmina Reza that premiered on 28 October 1994 at Comédie des Champs-Élysées in Paris. The English language adaptation, translated by Christopher Hampton opened in London's West End on 15 October 1996, starring Albert Finney. It played on Broadway in New York from Feb. 12, 1998 to Aug. 8, 1999. The March 1, 1998 opening night cast featured Alan Alda (Marc), Victor Garber (Serge), and Alfred Molina (Yvan) who was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance. ‘Art’ won the Tony for Best Play and went on to a 600 performance run. Replacement actors included Judd Hirsch, Joe Morton, George Wendt, Buck Henry, George Segal, and Wayne Knight. The comedy, which raises questions about art and friendship, concerns three long-time friends, Serge, Marc, and Yvan. Serge, indulging his penchant for modern art, buys a large, expensive, completely white painting. Marc is horrified, and their relationship suffers considerable strain as a result of their differing opinions about what constitutes "art. " Yvan, caught in the middle of the conflict, tries to please and mollify both of them. The play is not divided into acts and scenes in the traditional manner, but it does nevertheless fall into sections (numbered 1-17 by Pigeat). Some of these are dialogues between two characters, several are monologues where one of the characters addresses the audience directly, and one is a conversation among all three. At the beginning and end of the play, and for most of the scenes set in Serge's flat, the large white painting is on prominent display.
