Explanation of the novel's title
Perchance to Dream is written as a direct sequel to The Big Sleep , the title of which is a euphemism for death. [7] (The older novel includes a philosophical reflection on "sleeping the big sleep".) Continuing the play on words, the sequel derives its name from famous lines from Prince Hamlet's soliloquy in Hamlet , a tragedy by William Shakespeare : "to die: to sleepâ€” / To sleep, perchance to dream" (Act 3, Scene 1, Lines 63â€“64). [3] [8] [9] One reviewer snarkily suggested alternate titles including Maybe to Dream, The Bigger Sleep, and Sleep Bigger. [10]
Literary significance and reception
Reviewing the novel for The New York Times , author Martin Amis wrote that it "never amounts to more than a nostalgic curiosity" while finding the text "candidly puerile" and "full of stubbed toes and barked shins". [10] Josh Rubins of Entertainment Weekly allowed that "Parker has no trouble telling a story in the spare, coolly sardonic Chandler/Marlowe voice" but found Parker's Marlowe to be "a bit of a lightweight" and that "the tale Parker has concocted for this sequel doesn't seem worthy of the occasion". [1] Writing in the Los Angeles Times , Dick Lochte asserted that Parker "was no Chandler" but found the novel "entertaining" in its own right. [11] Author Robert Goldsborough reviewed the novel more positively for the Chicago Tribune , finding this book to be better than Poodle Springs and that Parker has "crafted a Marlowe tale stronger than most of Chandler's later work." [12]
