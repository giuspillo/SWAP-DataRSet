Plot Summary
Kommandant van Heerden, Piemburg's Chief of Police, is called out to deal with a strange murder case involving the eccentric British spinster, Miss Hazlestone. It appears that Miss Hazlestone has obliterated her cook with a quadruple-barreled elephant gun. As the cook was black, van Heerden is initially willing to brush the incident under the carpet, until Miss Hazlestone reveals that she and the cook were former lovers. van Heerden, a man with extremely racist sensibilities, is terrified of such information getting out, so he resorts to placing Miss Hazlestone under house arrest, calling in all the reinforcements he can to quarantine the area. Unfortunately, he has not accounted for his subordinate, the lethally incompetent Konstabel Els, nor the elephant gun Els has just collected from the crime scene.
