Reception
Reviewing the book, Jeffrey Cyphers Wright from The Brooklyn Rail stated that "highly stylized, fairly experimental, and original, the poems rely on sequential 'disruption' underpinned by a solidly smoldering focus. The thematic transference of significance becomes a mantra of sustenance amidst an arranged wilderness, 'It is all imagined, anchored by the word.'" [2] Publishers Weekly further acknowledged the poet's style: "Though raised in Baton Rouge, La., Ballard now seems energetically tied to San Francisco , since his offhand intensities, fiercely casual stance, quick free verse, and colloquial mysticism draw so frequently on two great sources of Bay Area poetics, the prophetic concentration of Robert Duncan and the extroversion of the beats."
