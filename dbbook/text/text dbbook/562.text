The Bondwoman's Narrative is a 2002 bestselling novel set in the mid-19th century by Hannah Crafts, a self-proclaimed runaway slave from North Carolina. The published novel has a preface by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. , a literature professor at Harvard University, describing the history of its acquisition, verification and publication. Scholars have speculated that the novel, possibly the first written by an African-American woman, was created between 1853 and 1861. It may precede the novel Our Nig, published in 1859.

Crafts's novel focuses on the experience of Hannah, a house slave , beginning with her explanation of being taught to read and write as a child by a kind old couple, who were subsequently discovered and reprimanded. Years later, Hannah's master hosts a large wedding . During the party, Hannah notices an unattractive old man subtly following her new mistress. Hannah concludes that â€œeach one was conscious of some great and important secret on the part of the other.â€� Indeed, in the coming weeks, after observing her new mistress lock herself away most of the day, Hannah comes to learn that the old man is Mr. Trappe, a crooked lawyer who has discovered that the mistress is a fair-skinned mulatto who is passing for white.
Hannah and the mistress flee the plantation in the middle of the night, become lost, and stay the night in a gloomy shack in the forest. The shack was recently the scene of a murder, and strewn with bloodstained weapons and clothes. Under these conditions, Hannah's mistress starts to go insane . Months later, the women are found by a group of hunters who escort them to prison. One of them, Horace, informs Hannah that her master slit his throat after their escape. The women are taken to prison, where they meet Mrs. Wright, a senile woman imprisoned for trying to help a slave girl escape. The mistressâ€™ insanity worsens. After several months, the women are moved to a house, where conditions are much better, but they are unable to leave or know the identity of their captor. After a lengthy imprisonment, it is revealed that their captor is Mr. Trappe. The mistress, upon learning this, suffers a brain aneurysm and dies.
Hannah is sold to a slave trader . As she is being transported, the cart horse bolts and runs the cart off a ledge. The slave trader is killed instantly. Hannah wakes up in the home of Mrs. Henry, a kindly woman who treats her well. As Hannah recuperates, Mrs. Henry is told that Hannahâ€™s previous owner wishes to claim her. Despite Hannahâ€™s pleas, the young woman is returned to the status of house slave, this time for Mrs. Wheeler, a vain, self-centered woman. When sent to town for facial powder, Hannah hears news of Mr. Trappeâ€™s death. After she returns with the powder, Mrs. Wheeler discovers that it reacts with her perfume, causing a blackening effect on her skin. Mrs. Wheeler has temporary blackface , causing her much discomfort. [2] After the family moves to North Carolina and another house slave replaces Hannah, Mrs. Wheeler suspects her of telling others about the blackface incident. As punishment, Hannah is ordered to the fields to be raped. Before being forced to join the field slaves, she flees again.
Hannah comes under the care of Mrs. Hetty, the kind woman who originally taught her to read and write. Mrs. Hetty facilitates Hannahâ€™s escape to the North , where the young woman rejoins her mother.

Major influences
Hannah Crafts was clearly influenced by the popular literary trends of the day. Scholar Hollis Robbins demonstrated that Crafts must have read prominent works of fiction such as Bleak House . Robbins also argues that Crafts may have read a serialized version of Dickens's novel in Frederick Douglass 's newspaper, which had a high circulation among runaway slaves. Scholar Catherine Keyser has argued for influences from Charlotte BrontÃ« 's Jane Eyre in Craft's writing.
