Critical reception
The poetry in District and Circle has been widely and positively reviewed by the critics. [6] In the Observer Review Andrew Motion wrote, "Due in large part to the richness of his language, and also to the undiminished freshness of his response to time-honoured things, its consolidations have the feel of celebrations. The book does not merely dig in, but digs deep." [7] The poet and critic Stephen Burt also praised the book, writing that "anyone who isnâ€™t impressed isnâ€™t listening." [8] Brad Leithauser , in the New York Times , praised Heaney for "saying something extraordinary while, line by line, conveying a sense that this is something an ordinary person might actually say". [9]
The critic Peter McDonald said "The book contains marvellous prose-poems on the peopled landscapes of his schooldays, along with sonnets - seemingly effortless in their sheer fluency, but memorably tough and intent". [10] Stephen Knight wrote that District and Circle was not "as immediate as his earlier work," but he still considered the book to be successful on its own terms, characterizing it as "a late flowering." [11]
