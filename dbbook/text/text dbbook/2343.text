The Postman (1985), is a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel by David Brin. A drifter stumbles across the uniform of an old United States Postal Service letter carrier and with empty promises of aid from the "Restored United States of America," gives hope to a community threatened by local warlords. The first two parts were published separately as "The Postman" (1982) and "Cyclops" (1984). Both were nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novella. The completed novel was awarded first prize in the John W. Campbell Award's for the best science fiction novel of the year in 1986, and won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel that same year. It was also nominated for Hugo and Nebula awards for best novel. In 1997, a film adaptation starring Kevin Costner was made of the novel.

Despite the post-apocalyptic scenario and several action sequences, the book is largely about civilization and symbols. Each of the three sections deals with a different symbol.
The first is the Postman himself, Gordon Krantz, who takes the uniform solely for warmth after he loses everything but his sleeping clothes. He wanders without establishing himself anywhere, and acts in scenes of William Shakespeare for supplies. Originally a student at the University of Minnesota , he has traveled west to Oregon in the aftermath of the world-wide chaos that resulted from several EMPs , the destruction of major cities, and the release of bioweapons . Taking shelter in a long-abandoned postal van, he finds a sack of mail and takes it to a nearby community to barter for food and shelter. His initial assertions to be a real postman builds, not because of a deliberate fraud (at least initially), but because people are desperate to believe in him and the Restored United States.
Later, in the second section, he encounters a community, Corvallis, Oregon , which is led by Cyclops, who is apparently a sentient artificial intelligence created at Oregon State University which miraculously survived the cataclysm. In reality, however, the machine ceased functioning during a battle and a group of scientists merely maintain the pretense of it working to try and keep hope, order, and knowledge alive.
Eventually, in the third section, as the Postman joins forces with Cyclops' scientists in a war against an influx of "hypersurvivalists", he begins to find that the hypersurvivalists are being pressed from Oregon's Rogue River area to the south as well. The hypersurvivalists are more commonly referred to as Holnists, after their founder, Nathan Holn. (Many times through the book, curses are uttered which damn Holn for his actions.) Nathan Holn was an author who championed a virulently violent, misogynistic, and hypersurvivalist society. Holn himself is said to have been hanged sometime before the events in the novel, but in the time following what should have been a brief period of civil disorder, followers of Holn prevented the United States from recovering from the limited war and the plagues that followed.
As the story comes to a climax, he allies with a tough tribal group made up of descendents of ranchers, loggers and Native Americans from SW Oregon's Umpqua Valley region who are led by a Native American who was a fomer special forces veteran. The Umpqua people have developed a warrior culture very similar to Native Americans of the old West and are bitter enemies of the Holnists and have defeated the Holnists at every turn but until the Postman they were not inclined to help the "weak" townsfolk of the Willamette Valley against the Holnists. At the end of the novel the Postman finds out the Holnists have another organized enemy to the South, the Holnists' southern enemy is a bit of a mystery, The Postman is only able to identify this Holnist enemy by the symbol that they rally behind: the Bear Flag . The final scenes of the novel gives the impression that the groups (symbols) may come together in an effort to revive civilization.
Another message of the plot deals with the backstory of the post-apocalyptic world: specifically, that it was not the electronics-destroying electromagnetic pulses , nor the destruction of major cities, nor the release of various bio-engineered plagues that actually destroyed society, but rather, it was the Holnists themselves, those who maintained large stockpiles of weapons and ammunition and preyed on humanitarian workers and other symbols of civilization.
