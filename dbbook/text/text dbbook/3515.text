Morgan's Passing is a 1980 novel by Anne Tyler.
Plot summary
Morgan Gower is a middle-aged husband and father who works at Cullen's Hardware Store. His life has fallen far short of his heroic aspirations, and he keeps a closet full of costumesâ€”priest, riverboat gambler, Daniel Boone outfitsâ€”donning a different costume nearly every day, wandering the streets of Baltimore , a man in search of an identity in which he feels comfortable. One day, he meets a young couple, Emily and Leon Meredith. Emily is in labor, and Morgan (posing as Doctor Morgan) delivers the baby in the backseat of his car. He stalks them and over a period of time becomes their friend. Leon and Emily are not the happy couple that they initially appeared to be, and eventually Morgan impregnates Emily. Morgan and Emily run off together, Morgan finally content as he assumes Leon's identity.
Reviews
John Leonard of The New York Times said, "Morgan, like a novelist, wants to be everybody else in order to look at himself through innocent eyes, to be charmed....Miss Tyler, witty, civilized, curious, with her radar ears and her quill pen dipped on one page in acid and on the next in orange liqueur, is asking whether art is adequate to the impersonations life insists on, death absolves. She is a wonderful writer." [2]
In The New York Review of Books James Wolcott compares Tyler to a "sentry or a detective [who] seems to notice everything: the pale fluorescent gloom of laundromats, pockets filled with lint-covered jellybeans, the smell of crabcakes and coconut oil on a Delaware beach, grapy veins in the calves of middle-aged mothers. As a chronicler of domestic fuss, Tyler can be compared to John Updike". [3]
