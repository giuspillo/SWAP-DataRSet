Why I Am Not a Muslim, a book written by Ibn Warraq , is a critique of Islam and the Qur'an . It was first published by Prometheus Books in the USA in 1995. The title of the book is a homage to Bertrand Russell 's essay, Why I Am Not a Christian , in which Russell criticizes the religion in which he was raised.
Outraged over the fatwa and death threats against Salman Rushdie , ibn Warraq assumes a pseudonym to pen what one critics calls "serious and thought-provoking book" using a "sledge-hammer" approach to "demolish" Islam. [1] The author's "polemic" criticizes Islam's mythology, theology, historic achievements, and current cultural influence. [1] Warraq, drawing largely on previous research, provides an "invaluable compilation" of Islam's shortcomings. He "makes a compelling case" that Islam is "flatly incompatible" with "individual rights and liberties of a liberal, democratic, secular state." [2]
