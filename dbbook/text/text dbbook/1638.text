Reception
The novel has been compared [1] to the successful Twilight series as a vampire romance. It is important to note however that The Silver Kiss was written several years before Twilight, has been successful by its own merits. Klause has been said to have successfully integrated "gory details" into a "sensuous and suspenseful story." [2] The novel has been cited in the psychology journal Adolescence as an example of literature that can help adolescents understand death, "enabling them to understand the impact of trauma and identify corrective responses."
