Good services ("At Your Service" in the US translation): a mystery with a strong element of social criticism.
The Droolings of the Devil ("Blow-Up" in the US translation): the story that inspired the film Blowup by Michelangelo Antonioni for its digressive execution of metalinguistic narrative and lucid contemplation; (its beginning guarantees it, never will you know how it has to be told, if in the first person or in the second, using the third person plural or continually inventing forms that serve no purpose)
The Pursuer: a homage to jazz and the creator of bebop , Charlie Parker , in which CortÃ¡zar unfurls countless musical choices, between allegories and metaphors , that reveal to the reader the author's exquisite passion for music.
Daily Terror ("Secret Weapons" in the US translation): the story of the same title as the book that assembles these stories, centering on the conflict between Pierre and Michele, a young couple in Paris after World War II .
