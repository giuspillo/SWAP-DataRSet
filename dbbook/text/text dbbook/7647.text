[5] Savage recounts how he first decided to start his advice column in 1991, while employed as the night manager of a video store in Madison , Wisconsin. [6] His friend Tim Keck joined him for a meal in Madison, on his way to Seattle , Washington to form a weekly publication, The Stranger . [6] Savage stated to Keck that he could contribute a weekly advice column with the recommended title of "Hey, Faggot", and this was later modified to become "Savage Love". [6]
Savage writes that communication is a key part of a good sexual experience: "After all, nothing makes a person better at sex than good communication. All sex therapists, advice columnists, and marriage counselors, serious, mainstream, pop culture, religious â€“ are all in agreement on this point". [7]
