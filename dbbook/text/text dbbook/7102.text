Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now! is a 1972 children's book by Dr. Seuss. Written as a book for early beginning readers, it is suitable for children who can not yet read at the level of more advanced beginning books such as The Cat in the Hat. The book presents, in short and funny fashion, Dr. Seuss's nonsensical words, rhymes, and illustrations. In the book, Marvin K. Mooney—ostensibly a young child whose bedtime has come—is asked to "go" in many ways.
