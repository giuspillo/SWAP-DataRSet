Film adaption
In December 2009, it was reported that DreamWorks Animation had set screenwriters Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Voris to write a film adaptation of the book, with Barry Sonnenfeld attached to direct it. [1] In 2011, Martinez wrote on his blog that he was working with DreamWorks on a project based on an original idea, and not on Gil's All Fright Diner. [2] In March 2013, Martinez expressed uncertainty for any film adaptation: "Your guess is as good as mine. It's all a matter of convincing someone with the clout necessary to make it happen." [3]
