Brave New Girl is a the first novel by Louisa Luna. It was published by MTV Books in early 2001. The book was written by Luna when she was at New York University.

The story takes place in Pasadena, California, the summer before Doreen's freshman year in high school. Doreen is a fourteen-year-old outcast with only one friend, the equally marginalized Ted. The two share an intense love of music and knowledge of what it's like to be alienated. The novel's title is a play on Aldous Huxley's Brave New World — a title which is itself drawn from William Shakespeare's The Tempest, act V, scene I.
