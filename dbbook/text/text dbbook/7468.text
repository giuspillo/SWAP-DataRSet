Slayer Slang: A Buffy the Vampire Slayer Lexicon is an academic publication relating to the fictional Buffyverse established by TV series, Buffy and Angel .
Book description
A distinguishing feature of the series Buffy was the way in which the show's writers play with language: making new words, changing existing ones, and turning common usage around. Michael Adams argues this creates a resonant lexicon reflecting power in both youth culture and television on the changes in American slang.
Contents
Michael Adams starts the book with a synopsis of the program's history and a defense of ephemeral language. The main body of the work is the detailed glossary of slayer slang, annotated with dialogue. The book concludes with a bibliography and a lengthy index, a guide to sources ( novels based on the show, magazine articles about the show, and language culled from the official posting board) and an appendix of slang-making suffixes.
