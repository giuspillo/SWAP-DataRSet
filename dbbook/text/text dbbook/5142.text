The Hallowed Hunt is a fantasy novel by Lois McMaster Bujold, published in 2005. It placed fourth in the annual Locus Poll for best fantasy novel.
Plot introduction
This novel is set in the same world as two of Bujold's previous fantasies, The Curse of Chalion (2001) and Paladin of Souls (2003), but in a country only mentioned there in passing. While the earlier books introduce a setting in which technology and society parallel those of a late medieval Earth and theology involves five deities, this one introduces intentional accumulation of spirits both animal and human. One of the five deities, the Son, reveals himself to the leading character, Ingrey. An unidentified deity, most likely the Son, appears to a leopard that has recently been killed.
Synopsis
The principal characters are Ingrey, who received a wolf spirit in childhood and spends most of the story discovering how, why and to what effect; Ijada, who receives a leopard spirit in a bungled rite; and Wencel, who has extended his life for centuries by taking over the bodies of others, mainly his own descendants, for a purpose that is finally revealed.
Ingrey is sent by his lord to take custody of Ijada, who has killed an heir to the kingdom, and bring her to the capital. During their journey, Ingrey learns of the circumstances of the death and does his best to protect Ijada. They become entangled in Wencel's grand plan, which is finally nearing fruition. In the end, Ijada and Ingrey together defeat him and marry.
