Kinflicks (1976) is a novel by American writer Lisa Alther. It was Alther's first published work, and the "subject of considerable pre-publication hyperbole."
Plot summary
The novel starts with a first-person reflection on her life so far by the protagonist, Virginia "Ginny" Hull Babcock Bliss, as she catches a plane to look after her gravely ill mother. From then on, dated chapters in third person alternate with Ginny's non-linear first-person reminiscences of her childhood, her teenage years, her college years, her marriage , and beyond.
Publication
The first printing consisted of 30,000 copies, and was chosen as an alternate selection of the Book of the Month Club . [1] It was "the subject of considerable pre-publication hyperbole..., soaring in the slip stream of Fear of Flying , Erica Jong 's bestselling hymn to the body electric . The novel proves againâ€”if any doubters still remainâ€”that women can write about physical functions just as frankly and, when the genes move them, as raunchily as men. It strikes a blow for the picara by putting a heroine through the same paces that once animated a Tom Jones or a Holden Caulfield . And it suggests that life seen from what was once called the distaff side suspiciously resembles the genitalia-centered existence that male novelists have so long monopolized." [1]
Critical reception
Nobel laureate Doris Lessing wrote of Kinflicks that Alther was "a strong, salty, original talent." [2]
Time called it an "abundantly entertaining progress through the unsettled 60s " and noted that "as exuberant caricature Kinflicks is authentically inspired"; while the novel "teems with cartoon eccentrics mouthing balloonfuls of inflated nonsense[, u]nhappily, Ginny [the protagonist] is equally one dimensional." [1]
More than 30 years after its publication, Katherine Dieckmann , reviewing the author's 2007 memoir, also commented on Kinflicks, calling it a "raucous novel [that] was all the rage among my high school set for its lurid paperback cover (nude female back, gilt lettering) and its frank talk of erections and lesbian hook-ups. Revisiting the novel 30 years later, itâ€™s clear the packaging sold the contents short: Altherâ€™s best-known book is a witty coming-of-age tale in which a tart-tongued protagonist named Ginny wanders her way through an identity crisis, mostly against a classic counterculture background."
