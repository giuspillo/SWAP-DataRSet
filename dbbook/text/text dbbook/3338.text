The plot follows McGee as he attempts to salvage the money of friend Arthur Wilkinson after the man is defrauded in a semi-legal confidence scheme involving a land deal. The title comes from a scene in the book where one of the characters, Vivian Crane, commits suicide wearing a bright orange outfit.
