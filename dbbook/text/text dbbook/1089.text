Just Imagine Stan Lee is a comic book published by DC Comics. It was the first work for DC Comics by Stan Lee, co-creator of numerous popular Marvel Comics characters, in which he reimagined several DC superheroes including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Aquaman, and The Flash. As an in-joke, Lee changes several of the civilian names of most famous DC superheroes to alliterative ones (i.e. both the first and last names begin with the same letter) in reference to Lee's tendency to use them for his Marvel Comics characters; for example Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Bruce Banner / Hulk, and Scott Summers / Cyclops.

He used a flying harness and managed to capture a dangerous criminal in a teleportation lab. However, the criminal put Salden and himself on a one-way trip to an insignificant little blue-green planet: Earth. The two men arrive separately, both discovering they have enhanced physical abilities. The criminal sets himself up as the king of a jungle tribe.
Earth is too primitive but it has the potential to develop the technology Salden needs to return to his homeworld. The problem is there are too many obstacles to the peaceful future necessary for technological advancement: war, crime, poverty, etc. Salden decides to become a superhero in order to rid the world of these impediments.

Wayne Williams' father was a policeman who was killed in an ambush. Wayne is framed for a crime, so he vows revenge on "Handz", the gang leader who set him up. In prison, Williams befriends a scientist named Frederick Grant who teaches him how to "develop his mind", as well as sewing and bodybuilding.
While incarcerated, Williams learns his mother has died and blames Handz. After rescuing the warden, he was given a full pardon. On the outside, Williams is on the run from Handz, so to keep a low profile he shaves his head. Williams needs money, so he becomes a wrestler under the name "Batman," never unmasking in public. In a few short weeks, "Batman" has become a superstar in wrestling and has become extremely wealthy. He searches for Grant and entrusts him with his secret identity. Wayne Williams has the money, skill and strength to fight Handz, but Frederick Grant has the technical know-how, so the two become partners. To keep a low profile, Wayne gives Frederick a mansion and acts as his bodyguard. Batman eventually finds and fights with Handz, who accidentally falls to his death in the conflict. No longer seeking vengeance, Batman begins a mission of justice to fight crime and protect the innocent from villains like Handz.
