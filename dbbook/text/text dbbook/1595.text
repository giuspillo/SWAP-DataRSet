Background
The first edition (1938) was edited by Prosper MontagnÃ© , with prefaces by Georges Auguste Escoffier and PhilÃ©as Gilbert . Gilbert was a collaborator in the creation of this book as well as Le Guide Culinaire with Escoffier, leading to some cross-over with the two books. It caused Escoffier to note when he was asked to write the preface that he could "see with my own eyes," and "MontagnÃ© cannot hide from me the fact that he has used Le Guide as a basis for his new book, and certainly used numerous recipes."

Translations and other editions
The book was translated into English in 1961.
