The Promised Land (orig. Polish: Ziemia Obiecana) is an 1898 novel by the Polish author and Nobel laureate, Władysław Reymont; first published in Warsaw, under foreign partitions of the country. It is considered one of his most important works after the prize-winning folk-epic Chłopi. The novel Ziemia obiecana was originally published as installments in the industrial city of Łódź by the Polish language daily Kurier Codzienny in the years 1897 – 1898. Set in Łódź, The Promised Land tells the story of three close friends and ruthless young industrialists: a Pole, a German, and a Jew struggling to build their own factory in the heartless world of the late 19th century labor exploitation. Reymont's novel vividly paints a portrait of the rapid industrialization of Łódź and its cruel effects on workers and mill owners. "For that land people were born. And it sucked everything in, crushed it in its powerful jaws, and chewed people and objects, the sky and the earth, in return giving useless millions to a handful of people, and hunger and hardship to the whole throng," he wrote.
