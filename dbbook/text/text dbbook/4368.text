Bad Chili is a crime mystery novel by American author Joe R. Lansdale. It is the fourth in the series of books featuring Lansdale's longtime protagonists Hap Collins and Leonard Pine. The two characters couldn't be more different; Hap is a white working class laborer who went to prison to protest the Vietnam war, and Leonard is a gay, black, Vietnam vet with serious anger issues. Both are experts in the martial arts and are the best of friends.
Plot summary
Hap returns from his off-shore oil platform job to discover that his best friend Leonard is being framed for a series of murders. The first of these is a biker who stole Leonard's boyfriend, and the second is Leonard's ex-boyfriend himself. The two of them set out to find who the real killers are and clear Leonard's name.
