Random Acts of Senseless Violence is a dystopian and speculative fiction novel by Jack Womack.
Plot introduction
The novel is told in the form of a fictional diary by the 12-year-old protagonist Lola Hart, and details Lola and her family's experiences in a near-future Manhattan in which violence, rising unemployment, and riots are commonplace in the city, as well as the rest of the United States . [2] As the novel progresses, Lola transforms from a student at one of Manhattan's most privileged private schools to a street-wise gangster as she and her family struggle to survive the despair of a crumbling government and economy.

Critical reception
The book did not attract significant attention on release; though there were a few reviews , it was not nominated for any awards even though Womack's previous work, Elvissey won the prestigious Philip K. Dick Award and was shortlisted for the Locus Award . [3] In a July 2008 article for Tor.com , Jo Walton decried the critical neglect of the work. [3] Walton speculated that its lack of prominence was due to its initial low-key reception, the "singularly appalling" cover art of the early editions, a title that was "off-putting" and misleading, and its disconnect from the zeitgeist of the time, which was focused on cyberpunk and space opera . [3] She was echoed by fellow science fiction author Cory Doctorow , who described the work as "an unflinching, engrossing, difficult coming-of-age story" and referred to it as "Womack's underappreciated masterpiece".
