Exit to Eden is a novel by Anne Rice, initially published in 1985 under the pen name Anne Rampling, but subsequently under Rice's name. The novel explores the subject of BDSM in romance novel form. The novel also brought attention to Rice's published works that differed from the type of writing she was better known for, such as her Sleeping Beauty series under yet another pen name. Additionally, a film adaptation in 1994 differed greatly from the book, with a new major story line and several new characters added. Each chapter in the novel is narrated in the first-person by either Lisa or Elliot; the narrator is announced at the head of each chapter.

Film adaptation
A film version, Exit To Eden was produced by Savoy Pictures in 1994 starring Dana Delany and Paul Mercurio in the roles of Elliot and Lisa, but was heavily rewritten by the studio as a buddy-cop comedy, using new characters played by Dan Aykroyd and Rosie O'Donnell . The film was almost universally panned by critics and Rice publicly dissociated herself from the production.[ citation needed ]
