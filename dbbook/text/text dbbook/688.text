Brewer's Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics is a reference book first published by Brewer's in 2002 and edited and compiled by William Donaldson. The book is an esoteric look at some of the wild characters emanating from the United Kingdom and has been described as "a work of maniacal genius". It featured entries on eccentrics and rogues famous, infamous and little-known, including Beauchamp Bagenal, Lord Berners, John Aspinall and John Wilkes. Some entries, such as that on George Best, reflect a certain cynicism about media-created rogues.
