Chicka Chicka Boom Boom is a bestselling children's book written by Bill Martin, Jr. and John Archambault, illustrated by Lois Ehlert, and published by Simon & Schuster in 1989. The book features anthropomorphized letters.
"P" having a black eye
"T" having a loose tooth
At night, "A" gets up and gets back up the coconut tree, daring the other letters to catch him.
The book is notable for its rhyming structure which is reminiscent of the jazz vocal improvisation technique known as scat singing .
An audio book version is also available.
It inspired a 2004 sequel, Chicka, Chicka, 1, 2, 3 . A board book for toddlers, entitled Chicka, Chicka ABC was published in 1990 and contains the first half of the full story.
