Introduction to Algorithms is a book by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. It is used as the textbook for algorithms courses at many universities. It is also one of the most commonly cited references for algorithms in published papers, with over 4900 citations documented on CiteSeerX. The book sold half a million copies during its first 20 years. Its fame has led to the appellation of the acronym "CLRS."
Editions
The first edition of the textbook did not include Stein as an author, and thus the book became known by the initialism CLR. After the addition of the fourth author in the second edition, many began to refer to the book as "CLRS". This first edition of the book was also known as "The Big White Book (of Algorithms)." With the second edition, the predominant color of the cover changed to green, causing the nickname to be shortened to just "The Big Book (of Algorithms)." [4] A third edition was published in August 2009.
CD-ROM
The second edition of the book published by McGraw-Hill is available with a companion CD-ROM including examples in Java.
