A film adaptation of this novel was released in 1998, directed by Richard Flanagan (who also wrote the screenplay), and featuring Kerry Fox , Kristof Kaczmarek, Rosie Flanagan and Arabella Wain. [2] The film was produced by Rolf de Heer who encouraged Flanagan to direct the film, and broke into tears and "was a mess for four days" when he first read the script. Flanagan first read the phrase "the sound of one hand clapping" in an essay about feminist influence on the early English co-operative movement. The film competed for the Golden Bear at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival . [3] [4]
