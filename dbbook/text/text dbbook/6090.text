Black and White is a book by David Macaulay. Released by Houghton Mifflin, it was the recipient of the Caldecott Medal for illustration in 1991. The book contains four different illustrated stories told at once, two on the left hand page and two on the right. Each story has a distinct artistic style; however, they all share similar characters, themes and plot elements leading the reader to believe that the four stories may or may not be one story told from different points of view. The overall effect is rather similar to that of the film Rashomon.
