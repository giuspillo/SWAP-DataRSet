Characters
Katie Chandler
A young Texas woman who has been always ordinary. She discovers that she is one of the rare people who has absolutely no magic in them and so magic can not be used on her. Because of this immunity she is recruited by MSI as a verifier. She can see through every spell or veiling without exception.
Owen Palmer
A shy, intelligent, powerful and gorgeous wizard who works for MSI. Owen works translating ancient spells. A former MSI employee, Phelan Idris, has a personal vendetta against him because Owen got him canned .
Rod Gwaltney
Owen's best friend since boyhood, Rod is a playboy who hides his not so attractive visage behind a very handsome illusion. He and Owen are the ones who recruit Katie
Merlin
The actual Merlin, from King Arthur. Merlin was woken from his enchanted sleep to help with some serious, imminent magical trouble. Merlin is very powerful and is fond of Katie, who teaches him about life in New York.
Phelan Idris
A former MSI employee who worked with Owen. Idris was fired for dappling in dark magic, MSI is strictly good, and Owen was the one who turned him in. Idris is now selling his own evil spells and Katie, Owen, and Merlin have to stop him before it is too late.
Ethan Wainwright
A lawyer who specializes in intellectual property. Katie and Ethan met on a date (He was set up with one of her roommates) and started talking about law. After consulting with Merlin, Katie asks Ethan out, mostly to find out if they had an intellectual property case against Idris. On their date Katie finds out that Ethan is an immune and recruits him to be a lawyer for MSI.
Sam
The head of security for MSI and also a gargoyle . Katie had been seeing him around the city for months prior to finding out that magic exists
Marcia & Gemma
Katie's roommates. Normal humans in every way (except maybe a little brighter and more beautiful).
