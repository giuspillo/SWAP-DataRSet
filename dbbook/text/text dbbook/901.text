Plot summary
Official tagline: "The sweeping historical tale of the coming of the Irish to Ireland, and of the men and women who made the Emerald Isle their own."
In the 4th century BC a group of Celts living in the north-west of Iberia , the Galicians, are waning in prosperity. A group of Phoenician traders unexpectedly arrives, and gives hope to the tribe.
The story follows Amergin, druid and chief bard of the Galicians, and his brothers; Ã‰remÃ³n, Colptha, Ã‰ber Finn, Donn, and Ã�r - all sons of Milesios. After years of declining prosperity, the Gaelicians hope that the Phoenician traders, led by Age-Nor , will help bring them back. Unfortunately, neither side has anything of much worth to trade. At a reception in the Heroes' Hall, Age-Nor is attacked by Ã�r, while Milesios is asleep and unaware. Amergin uses his bardic talent to entrance Ã�r, thus saving Age-Nor.
Later in the novel, Age-Nor rewards Amergin, despite the bard's vehement protests, by giving him a servant, a shipwright named Sakkar, and regaling him with a tale of a fabled land to the north, Ierne . After a series of mishaps and bad decisions, it is eventually decided that a group of the Gaelicians, led by the Sons of the Mil, will settle this land. The tribe builds a series of ships with the help of Sakkar, and set sail.
When they arrive on Ierne, they are confronted by the mysterious Tuatha DÃ© Danann , People of the Goddess Danu . After a battle, the Dananns vanish with no trace, leaving Ierne for the Milesians.
