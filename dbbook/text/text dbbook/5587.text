Call for the Dead is John le Carré's first novel, published in 1961. It introduces George Smiley, the most famous of le Carré's recurring characters, in a story about East German spies inside Great Britain. It also introduces a recurring fictional version of British Intelligence, called "the Circus" because of its location in Cambridge Circus, that is apparently based on MI6.
Plot summary
Foreign Office civil servant Samuel Fennan apparently commits suicide after a routine security check by Circus agent George Smiley . Smiley had interviewed and cleared Fennan only days previously after an anonymous accusation; however, Circus head of service Maston sets up Smiley to be blamed for Fennan's death. While interviewing Fennan's wife Elsa in her home, Smiley answers the telephone, expecting the call to be for him. It is a requested 8:30 call from the telephone exchange.
Smiley meets Inspector Mendel, a police officer on the verge of retirement who is investigating the Fennan case, who finds out that the call had been requested by Fennan the night before. When Elsa later tells Smiley that she requested the call from the exchange (which Smiley knows to be false), he tells Mendel and Maston. However, Maston unequivocally orders Smiley to refrain from any further investigation into Fennan's death. Back in his office, Smiley receives a letter posted by Fennan the night before, requesting an urgent meeting that day. Believing that Fennan was murdered to prevent the meeting, Smiley promptly resigns from the Circus and attaches his resignation to Fennan's letter, which he forwards to Maston.
Arriving home, Smiley notices a movement in the drawing room. He rings his own door bell and is met by a tall, fair, handsome stranger. Smiley skilfully avoids entering. He notes all the number plates of the seven cars parked in the road. Mendel traces one car to a car dealer, Adam Scarr.He tells Mendel that he rents it out twice a month to a stranger known as "Blondie", who matches Smiley's intruder. Smiley is subsequently attacked and nearly killed while trying to track the car to "Blondie", and Scarr is killed. Investigating further, Mendel learns that Elsa attends a local theatre twice a month with "Blondie", and that the two exchange music cases at each performance. "Blondie" is soon identified by fellow Circus agent Peter Guillam as Hans-Dieter Mundt, an East German agent under diplomatic cover working for Dieter Frey, a German spy of Smiley's during World War II who has since become an important East German agent. Smiley believes that Frey would use a courier like Mundt to service only one highly placed resident agent. Guillam reports that Mundt has fled England.
When confronted with Smiley's evidence, Elsa confesses to Smiley that her husband was an East German spy, that she was his unwilling accomplice in passing secret documents in the music cases, and that Fennan was killed by Mundt after Frey saw him talking to Smiley. However, Guillam learns that during the last six months, Fennan had been taking home insignificant, unclassified documents. Smiley realises that Elsa herself is the East German spy and that Fennan had accused himself to meet someone with whom he could discuss his suspicions about his wife. Smiley sets a trap, using his knowledge of Frey's tradecraft from the war to inspire a rendezvous between Frey and Elsa. When Frey utilises the meeting to kill Elsa, he is trailed by Mendel and killed by Smiley while attempting to escape.
Smiley turns down Maston's offer of promotion and flies to Zurich to see his estranged wife, Ann.
The antecedents of Smiley and Frey
The book starts with a chapter describing Smiley's earlier career (including his unlikely marriage to and unsurprising separation from Lady Ann Sercombe, a beautiful and promiscuous aristocrat), his recruitment by a lecturer in Oxford and his work in locating promising young Germans with "agent potential" and recommending them for recruitment by the British service prior to WWII.
One of these was Dieter Frey, a young German Communist who at the time had a common cause with Smiley in fighting the Nazis and also became his personal friend. Because of the Cold War, Frey had become Smiley's foe, while in a way still remaining his friend. When meeting Smiley again, in the fog near the Thames, Frey greets Smiley with "Servus, George!" before commencing the battle. After killing him, Smiley feels extremely guilty:
Dieter was dead, and he had killed him. The broken fingers of his right hand, the stiffness of his body and the sickening headache, the nausea of guilt, all testified to this. And Dieter had let him do it, had not fired the gun, had remembered their friendship when Smiley had not. They had fought in a cloud, in the rising steam of the river, in a clearing in timeless forest: they had met, two friends rejoined, and fought like beasts. Dieter had remembered and Smiley had not.
Dieter Frey is the first of several considerably sympathetic Jewish/Communist characters appearing in the le CarrÃ© books, followed by Liz Gold and Fiedler in The Spy Who Came in From the Cold .
