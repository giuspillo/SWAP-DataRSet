The Crack-Up (1945) is a collection of essays by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. It consists of previously unpublished letters, notes and also three essays originally written for and published first in the Esquire magazine during 1936. It was compiled and edited by Edmund Wilson shortly after Fitzgerald's death in 1940. The main essay starts "Of course all life is a process of breaking down .... " which gives something of the tone of the piece.

Reaction
The essays when originally written were poorly received and many reviewers were openly critical, particularly of the personal revelations. However time has been somewhat kinder to them and the collection is an insight into the mind of the writer during this low period in his life.
"The essays stand today as a compelling psychological portrait and an illustration of an important Fitzgerald theme" [2]
The philosopher Gilles Deleuze adopted the term crack-up from Fitzgerald to refer to his interpretation of the Freudian death instinct .
