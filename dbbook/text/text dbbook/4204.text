Plot summary
Jane Wilkinson, an actress, is suspected of murdering her husband, the fourth Baron Edgware, so that she can marry the Duke of Merton. The plot begins with Lady Edgware asking Poirot to convince her husband to agree to a divorce. When Poirot reluctantly does so, Edgware says that he has already agreed to a divorce and written a letter to Jane informing her of the fact. When Poirot reports this to Jane, she denies ever having received such a letter. On the night of the murder, Wilkinson supposedly goes to the Edgware house, announces herself to the butler, and goes into her husband's study. The next day, Lord Edgware is found murdered and Chief Inspector Japp informs Poirot. Numerous friends and acquaintances of Jane have described her as amoral, someone who only thinks and cares about herself and would certainly commit a crime if it would help her get what she wants. But in that morning's newspaper, they discover an article about a dinner party that was held the previous evening where Wilkinson was a guest.
At the party, there were thirteen guests at the dinner table. One guest mentioned that thirteen people at table means bad luck for the first guest to rise from the table (hence the alternative title of the book, Thirteen at Dinner) and Wilkinson was the first to rise. Among the guests is an actor named Donald Ross, who spent a lot of the evening speaking with Jane. So the police are, at first, baffled with the case, as is Poirot. On the same morning Lord Edgware's murder is discovered, comedienne/actress Carlotta Adams, known for her uncanny impersonations, including one of Wilkinson herself, is found dead from an overdose of Veronal . A mysterious gold case with the sleeping powder in it is found among her possessions. The case bears an inscription reading: "From D, Paris, November, 10th Sweet Dreams". Poirot tries to decode this and arranges the evidence together. A few days later, Wilkinson makes an appearance at another dinner party where several guests talk about Paris of Troy. However, the Jane Wilkinson at this dinner party thinks that the guests, again including actor Donald Ross, are referring to the French capital. Ross can't understand this because, at the party on the night of the murder, Jane was speaking knowledgeably about the mythological Paris. Ross goes to ring up Poirot about his discovery, but before he can say what he discovered, he is stabbed to death at his home; but Poirot is on the verge of solving the case, anyway.
Poirot gathers the suspects and details the trajectory of the crimes (the three murders): With Carlotta Adams impersonating Wilkinson, the real Jane took a taxi to the Edgware house, where she murdered her husband. She was overseen by her husband's secretary, whose vision and impartiality were later called into question in court. Later, Jane (in the person of "Mrs Van Dusen", an elderly American widow) and Carlotta met up in a hotel, where they toasted Carlotta's successful "performance", and (ostensibly) so that Jane could pay Carlotta. However, Jane slipped a fatal amount of Veronal into Carlotta's drink. Jane discovers a letter Carlotta had written to her sister but not yet posted, and was initially panicked by Carlotta's disclosure of the arrangement, which enabled Jane to murder her husband. However, rather than destroy the letter, as she initially intended, Jane saw a way she could use the letter to her advantage. At the top left hand corner of the second page is the word "she" (referring to Jane); she tore off the "s", leaving the word "he", making it seem a man had hired Carlotta. Jane then put the remaining Veronal inside the gold case to make it seem Carlotta was addicted to Veronal. Jane had ordered the gold case the week prior (as "Mrs Van Dusen"), which Poirot discovered when he questioned the engravers. Poirot realiseed that "November" was engraved on the case specifically to throw him off. Carlotta had been knowledgeable about Greek mythology, so she talked about the subject with Donald Ross that fateful night. At the second dinner party, Jane realised she'd made a potentially very serious mistake, left the party, and headed to Ross's home to kill him before he could tell Poirot. Her motive for killing Lord Edgware was this: the wealthy Duke of Merton is an Anglo-Catholic and would not marry a divorced woman; a widow, however, is a different matter. In the last chapter, she writes a letter to Poirot, remarkably devoid of any animosity, which ends with her wondering why hangings are not done in public any more.
Literary significance and reception
The Times Literary Supplement of 21 September 1933 reviewed the book positively, commenting on the fact that "it was the chance remark of a stranger in the street that put him on the right track. Three such murders, however, are enough to tax the powers of the most superhuman sleuth, and we do not grudge him one stroke of good fortune." [4]
Isaac Anderson concluded his review in 24 September 1933 issue of The New York Times Book Review by saying, "This story presents a most ingenious crime puzzle and a still more ingenious solution, all set forth with the consummate skill of which Agatha Christie is mistress." [5]
Robert Barnard : "Deals with a social/artistic milieu rather off Christie's usual beat: aristocrats, actresses, socialites, rich Jews. The anti-Semitism is more muted than in the early thrillers, but still leaves a nasty taste (this is the last book in which it obtrudes). Otherwise clever and unusual, with the Hastings/Poirot relationship done less crudely than usual." [6]
References to other works
In chapter 7, Poirot mentions that he once found a clue, but since it was four feet long instead of four centimetres, nobody would believe in it. This is probably a reference to a situation which occurred in The Murder on the Links , where Poirot found a piece of lead-piping which he concluded was used to disfigure the victim's face so that it would be unrecognisable. Nevertheless, the artefact was described in that novel as a piece of lead-piping only two feet long.
In chapter 25, Hastings tells Donald Ross that Poirot has left for an appointment relating to his investigation of another case, "the strange disappearance of an Ambassador's boots". When Poirot returns from the appointment, he tells Hastings that it was a case of cocaine smuggling, and that he had spent the last hour in a ladies' beauty parlor. This case sounds identical to the one in the Tommy and Tuppence story, "The Ambassador's Boots" from Partners in Crime (1929), except that Poirot mentions a girl with red hair (Hastings is often described by Poirot as partial to redheads), while the girl in "The Ambassador's Boots" has blonde hair, or black hair when in disguise.

The character of Carlotta Adams was based on the American dramatist Ruth Draper (1884â€“1956). In her Autobiography , Christie says, "I thought how clever she was and how good her impersonations were; the wonderful way she could transform herself from a nagging wife to a peasant girl kneeling in a cathedral. Thinking about her led me to the book Lord Edgware Dies.â€� [7] In writing this, Christie forgot that she had previously used the Draper idea in the short story The Dead Harlequin , published in The Mysterious Mr. Quin (1930), where the character was called Aspasia Glen and was the murderer's accomplice, rather than the victim.
In Chapter 7, Chief Inspector Japp mentions the Elizabeth Canning case which was a real kidnapping case occurred in London in 1753. Such case created a lot of sensation in its time due to the inconsistencies of the victim's declarations and the alibis of the perpetrators. Japp mentions this case due to the particular fact that the suspect was seen at two places at the same time. In the novel Lady Edgware was seen at a dinner party at the time that she was also seen visiting the victim; whereas in the Canning case the suspect, Mary Squires, was seen travelling during the time that Elizabeth Canning said she had her imprisoned.
