Introduction
The Children's Hospital is a very long, ambitious work, with the first edition copies running some 615 pages long [1] . The novel starts within the maternity ward of a famous hospital. As a storm rages outside, third-year medical student Jemma Claflin helps deliver another complicated birth. The storm soon floods the rest of the earth beneath seven miles of water. The hospital begins to float and the survivors try to retain a semblance of normal life, combating the illness of their patients and setting up an internal government.
