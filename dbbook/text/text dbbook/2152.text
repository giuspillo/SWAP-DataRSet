Farmer Boy is a children's historical novel by Laura Ingalls Wilder. First published in 1933, it is the second book in the nine part Little House series, also known as "The Laura Years". Although it was the second book written, Farmer Boy is usually read third in the series, following Little House on the Prairie.
Plot summary
Farmer Boy is based on the childhood of Laura's husband, Almanzo Wilder , who grew up in the 1860s near the town of Malone in upstate New York. The book covers more than one year in Almanzo's life, beginning just before his ninth birthday, and following at least two harvest cycles. It [2] describes in detail the endless chores involved in running the Wilder family farm. Young as he is, Almanzo rises before 5 a.m. every day to milk several cows and feed stock. In the growing season, he plants and tends crops; in winter, he hauls logs, helps fill the ice house, trains a team of young oxen, and sometimesâ€”when his father can spare himâ€”goes to school. The novel includes stories of Almanzo's brother Royal and his sisters Eliza Jane and Alice.
Historical background
Since Almanzo (1857-1949) was born in February 1857, the novel is set in 1866â€“1867, prior to the birth of the author, Laura Ingalls Wilder (1867â€“1957). The book features Almanzo's brother Royal (1847â€“1925) and sisters Eliza Jane (1850â€“1930) and Alice (1853â€“1892). Meanwhile, he also had a sister Laura (1844â€“1899), who at the time and events in the novel was already about 22 and had presumably moved out. He later had a brother, Perley Day (1869â€“1934), who was not yet born at the time Farmer Boy is set. [3]
