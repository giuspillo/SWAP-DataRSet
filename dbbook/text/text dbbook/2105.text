Tarzan and the Leopard Men is a novel written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the eighteenth in his series of books about the title character Tarzan. Its plot has nothing in common with the 1946 film "Tarzan and the Leopard Woman."
Plot summary
An amnesiac Tarzan and his monkey companion Nkima are taken by an African warrior to be his guardian spirits, and as such come into conflict with the murderous secret society of the Leopard Men , led by Gato Mgungu.
From America, a young woman arrives in the territory in search of a loved one presumed missing, and two young men (also from that country) come in search of ivory.
