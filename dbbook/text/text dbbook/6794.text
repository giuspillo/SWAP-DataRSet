Nietzsche and Philosophy (French: Nietzsche et la philosophie) is a 1962 book about Friedrich Nietzsche by philosopher Gilles Deleuze. Its publication marked a significant turning-point in French philosophy, which had previously given little consideration to Nietzsche as a serious philosopher. Nietzsche and Philosophy was the first French study of Nietzsche to treat him as a systematically coherent philosopher. It raised questions that became central to Nietzsche studies and to French post-structuralism generally. Within Nietzsche scholarship, the book was notable for giving serious consideration to the concepts of the will to power and the eternal return.
