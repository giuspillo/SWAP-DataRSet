The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn is a crime novel by Colin Dexter, the third novel in Inspector Morse series.
Television adaptation
The novel was adapted as the second episode of the Inspector Morse TV series in 1987, guest starring Barbara Flynn as Monica Height, Michael Gough as Philip Ogleby, Clive Swift as Dr Bartlett, Anthony Smee as Roope, Roger Lloyd Pack as Donald Martin and Phil Nice as Nicholas Quinn. The adaptation remained faithful to the source material, the only noticeable changes being the omission of much of the material prior to Quinn's murder (the television version begins with him already employed by the syndicate), a subplot concerning Bartlett having a schizophrenic son, and the film the characters viewed being changed to Last Tango in Paris .
In 1996 the BBC Radio 4 play The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn (dramatised from the novel by Guy Meredith ) had John Shrapnel playing Morse and Robert Glenister as Lewis, with Richard Pasco as Dr Bartlett, Meg Davies as Monica Height, Stephen Critchlow as Donald Martin, David Timson as Philip Ogleby, John Hartley as Dr Roope and Chief Supt. Strange, Lyndam Gregory as Sgt Dixon, and Roger May as Nicholas Quinn. The play was directed by Ned Chaillet . [1]
