Ella Enchanted is a Newbery Honor book written by Gail Carson Levine and published in 1997. The story is a retelling of Cinderella featuring various mythical creatures including fairies, elves, ogres, gnomes, and giants. In 2006, Levine went on to write Fairest, a retelling of the story of Snow White, set in the same world as Ella Enchanted.
Critical reception
Common Sense Media, a family-based reviewing site, rated the book with four stars out of five, suggesting it for readers over 11 due to some minor, violent themes. With regard to the main character Ella, they state, "She is a strong and intelligent role modelâ€”instead of taking her misfortune sitting down, she marches off to rid herself of the troublesome curse."

Film
On April 9, 2004, an American movie loosely based on the novel was released. It was directed by Tommy O'Haver and starred Anne Hathaway and Hugh Dancy as Ella and Char, respectively. The film received mostly mixed reviews, and was heavily criticized for its changes to the source material. Levine stated that the film is "so different from the book that it's hard to compare them," noting the addition of new characters such as Sir Edgar and Heston, and suggested "regarding the movie as a separate creative act".
