At the local school (Hardy Elementary School), Mark initially decides to ignore everyone. However, after camping out in the old barn in his yard, he decides to become more friendly and tries to be nice to the teachers. The fifth grade's annual camping trip in the woods tests Mark's survival skills and his ability to relate to a teacher named Mr. William Maxwell who seems out to get him.
