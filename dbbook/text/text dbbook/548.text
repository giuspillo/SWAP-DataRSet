Night Train to Lisbon (2004) is a philosophical novel by Pascal Mercier originally published in German as Nachtzug nach Lissabon in 2004 and published in English in 2008. The novel is an international best seller. It recounts the travels of Swiss Classics instructor Raimund Gregorius as he explores the life of Amadeu de Prado, a Portuguese doctor during the António de Oliveira Salazar's right-wing dictatorship in Portugal. Prado is a serious thinker whose active mind becomes evident in a series of his notes collected and read by Gregorius.
Characters
Raimund Gregorius is a teacher at a Swiss Gymnasium in modern day Bern, expert in ancient languages, Greek, Latin and Hebrew. He encounters a mysterious woman, which leads him to find a mysterious book. To understand its author, Amadeu de Prado, he abandons his teaching position and goes to Lisbon, where he investigates Prado and his associates.
Amadeu de Prado was a doctor and the author of the book Gregorius is reading. He lived during the Salazar Dictatorship , which began in 1928 and ended in 1974. Prado had a strong interest in literature, and because of this awareness begins questioning the world, the experiences he knows, and words contained in conversation and written thought. He writes these ideas in a series of notes and journal entries which his sister, Adriana, edits and publishes. His life and his thoughts are strongly influenced by the dictatorship around him. His father is a judge. Prado saves the life of the Regime's Chief of Secret police, and, in reaction to others' criticism of him, joins the resistance movement.
Themes
Night Train to Lisbon spends considerable time contemplating ideas, both exploring Gregorious's contemplation of self and exploring de Prado's journal and own philosophical explorations. [2] Epigraphs include Michel de Montaigne, Essais, Second Book, I, â€œDe lâ€™inconstance de nos actionsâ€� and Fernando Pessoa, Livro do Desassossego. Mercier uses various activities and subthemes to help explore these deep self-reflective subjects including "night journeys, insomnia and dream-filled sleep, of being stuck in place yet somehow adrift, and confusion about life's purpose." With this introspective perspective, Mercier is able to review concepts of "who we are, how we control our experience of life, and how fragile that construction is." [3]
Style
Like the depiction of the city of Lisbon as mysterious and intricate, the text of Night Train to Lisbon is intricate and complicated, sometimes withholding information from the reader. [2] [4] Multiple reviewers also pointed to the thriller qualities the novel takes on despite the philosophical focus of the themes. [3] [4]
Critical reception
Anne Phillips in the The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana, IL) noted that Night Train to Lisbon was "reminiscent of Carlos Ruiz Zafon 's " The Shadow of the Wind " and commented that "mystery romance and political intrigue" keep the pages turning. [5] Robert Moyle of the Herald Sun also points out how engaging Night Train to Lisbon is, pointing out how easy it is for the reader to identify with Gregorius. [3] Daniel Johnson of the The Telegraph placed Mercier, with this novel, amongst the best European novelists alive. [4]
