The Ice-Shirt is a 1990 historical novel by American author William T. Vollmann. It is the first book in a seven-book series called Seven Dreams: A Book of North American Landscapes.
2.4 Freydis Eiriksdottir
Fact, Fiction, Meta-fiction
The Ice-Shirt is set in the 10th century A.D. and chronicles the arrival of the Norse people in Greenland , Vinland , and the Arctic . The novel blends historical fiction, modern journalism, and the elaborate mythology of the peoples in question, which include Norse , Mi'kmaq , and Inuit . In addition to other Norse sagas such as the Heimskringla , the novel draws heavily from the FlateyjarbÃ³k , a 14th-century Icelandic manuscript (especially the GrÅ“nlendinga saga ), with particular focus on the character FreydÃ­s EirÃ­ksdÃ³ttir .
Schema
In addition to the story itself, The Ice-Shirt comprises a preface, a foreword and afterword, glossaries (of characters; places; "dynasties, races and monsters"; and of primary texts), a chronology, and a list of secondary texts. Illustrations by the author (such as his drawings of Icelandic plants, his renderings of ancient maps, and a self-portrait) and free-ranging footnotes are interspersed throughout the book.
The story proper is told in four parts (called movements) with a total of 25 chapters. The longest chapter has 26 subsections; the shortest chapters have only one. Vollmann uses nearly twenty of the subsections to talk about his own northland experiences in the late 1980s; three of these recount the northland experiences told to him by another traveler.
