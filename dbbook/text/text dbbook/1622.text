Naked Came the Phoenix: A Serial Novel is a 2001 mystery novel written in serial installments by thirteen popular female authors, including collaboration editor Marcia Talley. The title was intended to evoke 1969's famously-collaborative Naked Came the Stranger rather than the 1996 parody Naked Came the Manatee.
