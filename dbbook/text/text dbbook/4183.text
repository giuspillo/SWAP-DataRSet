Kat Kong is a children's picture book created by Dav Pilkey that parodies King Kong with a housecat. Harcourt Brace & Company published this title in 1993. “The illustrations in this book are manipulated photographic collage, heavily retouched with acrylic paint. ” The photographs of the animals are of Pilkey’s own pets: Flash starring as Professor Vincent Varmit, Rabies as Rosie Rodent, Dwayne as Captain Charles Limburger, and Blueberry as the Monster. Kat Kong is dedicated to Nate Howard, who tamed the savage kitty and the book has been rated TS, meaning “Terribly Silly. ” A similar title is Dav Pilkey’s Dogzilla, which spoofs Godzilla. "The irrepressible Pilkey strikes again with a spoof of the famous film, enacted by a real cat and some mice in color photo images imposed on background paintings. Artfully designed, colorful, and funny--especially for those who know King Kong. "—Kirkus Reviews Distributed by Syndetic Solutions, Inc.
