A Gun For Sale is a 1936 novel by Graham Greene. The novel was first published by Doubleday Doran in the U.S. in June 1936 as This Gun For Hire; it was published by William Heinemann in the U.K. in July 1936 as A Gun For Sale. Raven is a man dedicated to ugly deeds. When Raven is paid for killing the Minister of War with stolen notes, he becomes a man on the run. Tracking down the agent who double-crossed him, and eluding the police simultaneously, he becomes both the hunter and the hunted. The novel ties into Greene's later, more famous work, Brighton Rock. Raven's assassination of Kite, the Colleoni's rival mob boss, sets the event of Brighton Rock in motion in much the same way that Raven's assassination of the Minister of War sows the seeds for global conflict in A Gun For Sale. A 1941 film version starred Alan Ladd under the title This Gun for Hire (the title of the book's U.S. edition).
