Criticism
Author, professor and finance consultant, Donald Mitchell criticizes The Millionaire Mind saying, "because of the way the sample was selected, you won't get much variety...[and that a] control group is essentially missing.... [3]
Web blogger, Jim Lippard , also criticizes Stanley's work with a similar accusation, stating, "This is a deeply flawed book. It purports to be a description of the characteristics and attitudes that make wealthy people wealthy, but it is based mostly on their self-assessments without comparison to a control group. I suspect that this heavily underplays the role of random chance in success, and attributes causation where there is only correlation. Further, the author displays clear biases on a number of topics, which leads him to engage in ad hoc interpretation of his data, sometimes to argue for conclusions that are contrary to the clear implications of the dataâ€”such as his arguments for the importance of religion in the lives of millionaires."
