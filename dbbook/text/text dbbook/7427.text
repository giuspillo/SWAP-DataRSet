A Man Without a Country is an essay collection published in 2005 by the author Kurt Vonnegut. The extremely short essays that comprise this book deal with topics ranging from the importance of humor, to problems with modern technology, to Vonnegut's opinions on the differences between men and women. Most prevalent in the text, however, are those essays which elucidate Vonnegut's opinions on politics, and the issues in modern American society, often from a decidedly humanistic perspective. In January 2007, Vonnegut indicated that he intended this to be his final work, a statement which proved to be correct with his death in April 2007. This stood true until a short-story collection of his unpublished work was published posthumously in 2008 entitled Armageddon in Retrospect.
