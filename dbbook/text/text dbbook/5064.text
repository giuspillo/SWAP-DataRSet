Reception
Leroy Douresseaux recommends the first volume to "readers who enjoy fiction set in the modern hook-up culture". [4] Holly Ellingwood enjoyed Yuasa's "unkempt" character design. [5] Briana Lawrence enjoyed the complexities of the story, despite not enjoying the art and not looking forward to a story featuring a student/teacher relationship. [6] Writing about the second volume, she said "I cannot stress enough how great these characters are. Each one is believable and Iâ€™m in love with every single one of them. The plot is soâ€¦ real!" [7] For Leroy Douresseaux, the second volume "never really comes together", feeling more like "a collection of scenes" than a sustained narrative. [8] Holly Ellingwood felt the second volume was "a great change of pace from the regular yaoi manga with its unexpected turns and unique comedic take on the situation of these four men". [9] Briana Lawrence found some aspects of the ending disappointing, especially characters conveniently disappearing. [10] Leroy Douressaux feels the final volume "has more talking than it does coupling" and compares it to Friends. [11] Rachel Bentham felt Asahina was entertaining in the final volume because of his "backwards way of saying 'I love you'". [12]
