Plot
The Warrior's Apprentice features the first appearance by regular Bujold protagonist Miles Vorkosigan. He flunks out of the Barrayan milliary academy after breaking both legs, brittle bones being one of the legacies of a gas attack on his pregnant mother. With his bodyguard Bothari and Bothari's daughter Elena, he goes to Beta Colony to visit his grandmother. There he finds himself the owner of an obsolete freighter and establishes a new identity for himself as the commander of a mercenary fleet. In this new role the three of them become involved in smuggling weapons during an interplanetary war.
Reception
Jo Walton, writing for Tor.com, described The Warrior's Apprentice as having "about ninety percent more depth than youâ€™d expect it to have", but also notes that "the series does get a lot deeper and more complex as it goes on from here." [2]
