Title
The title for the collection was chosen by its original editor, Jeanne Schulkind, based on a passage from "Sketch of the Past". As described by Woolf, 'moments of being' are moments in which an individual experiences a sense of reality, in contrast to the states of 'non-being' that dominate most of an individual's conscious life, in which they are separated from reality by a protective covering. Moments of being could be a result of instances of shock, discovery or revelation.
Moments of Being consists of 5 autobiographical essays:
"Reminisces" (1907)
"22 Hyde Park Gate" (1920/1)
"Old Bloomsbury" (1921/2)
"Am I a Snob?" (1936)
"22 Hyde Park Gate", "Old Bloomsbury" and "Am I a Snob?" were written for the Memoir Club, a group formed in 1920 by Molly MacCarthy , who met to present honest autobiographical papers.
