Plot summary
Miles and Ivan are sent to the home world of the Cetagandan Empire to represent Barrayar at the Imperial funeral of the dowager Empress, mother of the current Emperor. They soon become entangled in an internal Cetagandan plot which leads to murder.
Miles forms an unusual alliance with Rian Degtiar, the "Handmaiden of the Star CrÃ¨che", who is charged with the duties of Empress until the new one is chosen. Miles solves the complex mystery and prevents the Cetagandan Empire from fragmenting into nine dangerously expansionist-minded parts. Then, much to his chagrin, he is publicly awarded the "Order of Merit", the highest Cetagandan award, by the Emperor himself. He also picks up clues to a Cetagandan genetic experiment, which becomes the object of much skulduggery in Ethan of Athos .

[2] It received mixed reviews, with The SF Site stating that it has "a good and delicious mystery at its core", [3] while a Tor.com review stated "I donâ€™t find the Cetagandan political set-up very plausible, and worse, I donâ€™t find it very interesting." [4] SFF.net stated that "All in all, this is certainly an enjoyable book, though not (Bujold's) best. [5]
