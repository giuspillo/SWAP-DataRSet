Reception
Of the abridged audiobook, AudioFile criticized the book's abridging, stating it was a "particularly graceless and inept reading that should horrify the author, if no one else". [2] The Library Journal wrote that Punish the Sinners was an "Essential for those libraries with Saul fans", praising the audiobook's narration. [3]
Literary criticism
In his book John Saul: a critical companion, Paul Bail wrote that the plot "owes as much to the protagonist's personal flaws as to the villain's conspiratorial machinations. The hero's inner compulsions repeatedly draw him to the very danger that threatens to consume him." Bail also noted that the book differed from some of Saul's other works in that it focused on a male protagonist and that it contained "factually historical underpinnings". [4]
