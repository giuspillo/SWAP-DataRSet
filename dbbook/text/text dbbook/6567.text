Summary
The prologue is a letter from Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, "To my lawyer, Saxonberg", accompanied by a drawing of her writing at her office desk. It is the cover letter for the 158â€‘page narrative, which provides background for changes to her last will and testament.
Twelve-year-old Claudia Kincaid decides to run away from home happily, because she thinks her parents do not appreciate her and she doesn't like it. She chooses the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met) in New York City , with nine-year-old brother Jamie as companion partly because he has saved all his money. With one unused adult fare on the commuter train and one very long walk, they get there at no cost when admission is free.
Early chapters show how Claudia and Jamie settle in at the Met: hiding in the bathroom at closing time from staff on circuit to see that all the patrons have departed; blending with school groups on tour, to learn more about the museum exhibits; bathing in the fountain, whose "wishing coins" provide income; sleeping in an antique bed.
A new exhibit draws sensational crowds and fascinates the children: the marble statue of an angel, sculptor unknown but suspected to be Michelangelo . It was purchased at auction from Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, a collector who recently closed her showcase Manhattan residence. They research it on site and at the Donnell Library , and give their conclusion to the museum staff anonymously.
After learning they have been naive, the children spend the last of their money on travel to Mrs. Frankweiler's home in Connecticut. She recognizes them as runaways but sets them briefly to the task of researching the angel in her long bank of file cabinets. Despite the idiosyncratic organization of her files, they do discover the angel's secret. In exchange for a full account of their adventure, she will leave the crucial file to them in her will, and send them home in her Rolls-Royce . It's a deal.
Claudia learns her deep motive for persisting in the crazy search: she wanted a secret of her own to treasure and keep. Mrs. Frankweiler may get "grandchildren" who delight her. Her lawyer gets a luncheon date at the Met, to revise her will.

Origins
When Konigsburg submitted Mixedâ€‘Up Files to Jean Karl at Atheneum in 1966, she was an unpublished mother of three children living in the suburbs of New York City. [8]
One inspiration for the novel was a page-one story in the New York Times on October 26, 1965. [a] Konigsburg recalled years later that the Metropolitan Museum had purchased for only $225 a plaster and stucco statue from the time of the Italian Renaissance . "They knew they had an enormous bargain." [8] [9]
Another inspiration was complaints by Konigsburg's children in Yellowstone National Park , about a picnic with many amenities of home. She inferred that if they ever ran away "[t]hey would certainly never consider any place less elegant than the Metropolitan Museum of Art". [9]
The author's two younger children Laurie and Ross (who turned eleven and nine in 1967) posed for the illustrations of Claudia and Jamie. Anita Brigham, a neighbor in their Port Chester, New York , apartment house posed as Mrs. Frankweiler. [10]
The character of Mrs. Frankweiler was based on Headmistress Olga Pratt at Bartram's School for Girls in Jacksonville, Florida , where Konigsburg once taught chemistry . "Miss Pratt was not wealthy, but she was a matter-of-fact person. Kind, but firm." [10]
There were three adaptations before 1998, all under the original title. [1]
1969 audio cassette (Miller-Brody/Random House)
1973 feature film starring Ingrid Bergman (Cinema 5) â€”later released as The Hideaways (Bing Crosby, 1974); [1] The Hideaways UK title [11] and home video title [12]
