Plot Summary
Cover of the UK first edition.
Gary spends time playing football, picnicking with a girl named Myna, and contemplating nuclear warfare . Its meditative but ultimately playful nature, spry dialogue, and deep but mostly unconnected themes make End Zone perhaps the most easily accessible of DeLillo's early works.
The metaphor of football as warfare is challenged in the line "warfare is warfare."
Film Adaptation
