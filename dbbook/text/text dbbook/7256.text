Summary
According to the publisher, in the book "Hannity offers a survey of the world â€” political, social, and cultural â€” as he sees it." [1] The book has been described as "an unapologetic diatribe against liberalism , questioning its logic and posing questions about the outcome of its agenda for Americans". [2]
The book's publisher, ReganBooks , a division of HarperCollins , was owned by Rupert Murdoch , owner of Fox News . [3]
Reception and views
Radio broadcaster Rush Limbaugh said that Hannity wrote with "a vigor and clarity that inspires," and that the book was a "page turner". [4]
Dr. James Dobson said Hannity was "to be commended, admired â€” and watched!" [4]
The Conservative Book Club said that Hannity "proves that liberal ideas have made America more vulnerable and created confusion in our society." [4]
Kathryn Jean Lopez , reviewing the book for the National Review Online , said, "Rather than just calling those who disagree with him 'the enemy,' which he could have done and still sold books, Hannity communicates a real respect for the other guy's opinion, even if he thinks it insanely wrong â€” and it's this decency that gets people coming back to him." [5]
Todd Seavey of People magazine said the book was "an amusing tour guide of an imaginary Museum of Modern Left-Wing Lunacy," and that Hannity's "outrage is entertaining." [6]
