Synopsis
The Concubine's Children documents the life of Denise Chongâ€™s grandfather, Chan Sam; grandmother, May-ying; her mother, Hing (or Winnie, as she was known outside of Chinatown); her motherâ€™s siblings, Ping, Nan, and Gok-leng; and half sibling, Yuen. Chan Sam had two wives, May-ying in Canada and Huangbo in China, dividing the family between Canada and China. Chongâ€™s mother, Hing, only knew one of her siblings while growing up, Gok-leng. [3] The Concubineâ€™s Children documents the story of this family which spanned two continents, as well as the political, social, and cultural tensions in China and Canada, between 1848, when Chan Samâ€™s father, Chongâ€™s great grandfather, first came to " Gold Mountain â€�, the nickname by which Chinese people knew North America, and 1987 when Chong and Hing first met the "China family". [3]
Chong was inspired to work on this family historyâ€“historical non-fiction novel after moving to Beijing in 1985, with her companion, and later husband, CTV correspondent Roger Smith. [3]
While living in Peking , Denise Chong convinced her mother Hing/Winnie to join her on a three-week trip of China , which would take them to the village of Chang Gar Bin. Chang Gar Bin was Chan Samâ€™s (Hing/Winnieâ€™s father and Denise Chongâ€™s grandfather)'s hometown, and the place where Hingâ€™s sisters, Ping and Nan, and half-brother Yueng, all of whom she had never met, had been raised. [3] Before going to Chang Gar Bin, Denise contacted the Chinese foreign ministry in Canton, and discovered that two of her motherâ€™s siblings were still alive and living in Char Gar Bing. Hing's sister Nan had died when Hing was still a child and she had been aware of this passing. [3] The Concubineâ€™s Children ends with a chapter describing this trip and the first meeting between then, 57-year-old Hing/Winnie and her siblings. [3]
Media adaptations
Before being published as a novel, The Concubineâ€™s Children appeared as an article in the magazine Saturday Night . [3] Indeed, the editor of this magazine, John Fraser, was instrumental in encouraging Denise Chong to produce her book. [3] Since then The Concubineâ€™s Children has been converted into a stage play, by Chong herself. The play debuted in 2004 at TheatreOne in Nanaimo , BC, directed by Rick Scott. [4]
