Catch Me if You Can is Frank Abagnale's autobiography, written with the help of Stan Redding.
The movie plot is available at Catch Me If You Can .
The book details the life of Frank Abagnale , who was one of the most famous con-artists in the 20th century. It is written in the first person and describes how he cashed $ 2.5 million worth of bad checks. He assumed various jobs, such as pretending to be a Pan Am pilot, a doctor, a teacher, and an attorney. Abagnale was eventually caught by the FBI Agents, who had been chasing him the whole way, while living in France and then served approximately five years in prison - six months in France, six months in Sweden , and four years in the United States. The book ends with an epilogue telling the story of Frank Abagnale's final capture and the story of his rehabilitation which resulted in the creation of his security firm.
In order to promote the movie, the book was released again in 2002, however the epilogue was removed and this edition of the book ends with Abagnale running away from the FBI.
Movie adaptation
The 2002 film Catch Me if You Can , directed by award-winning director Steven Spielberg , stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Abagnale and Tom Hanks as Hanratty. The film is based upon his life and the autobiography and is mainly true to the source as Abagnale was a consultant to the writers but some of the details were changed to create a more dramatic narrative for film.
