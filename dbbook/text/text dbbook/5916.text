The King in Yellow is a collection of tales of the supernatural by Robert W. Chambers, named after a fictional play with the same title that recurs as a motif through some of its stories and first published by F. Tennyson Neely in 1895. Described by S.T. Joshi as a classic in the field of the supernatural, it contains 10 stories, the first four of which, "The Repairer of Reputations", "The Mask", "In the Court of the Dragon" and "The Yellow Sign", mention The King in Yellow, a forbidden play which induces despair or madness in those who read it. "The Yellow Sign" inspired a film of the same name released in 2001.
The first four stories are loosely connected by three main devices:
A play in book form entitled The King in Yellow
A mysterious and malevolent supernatural entity known as The King in Yellow
An eerie symbol called The Yellow Sign
These stories are macabre in tone, centering, in keeping with the other tales, on characters that are often artists or decadents . The first and fourth stories, "The Repairer of Reputations" and "The Yellow Sign", are set in an imagined future 1920s America, whereas the second and third stories "The Mask" and "In the Court of the Dragon" are set in Paris. These stories are haunted by the theme of "Have you seen The Yellow Sign?"
The weird and macabre character gradually fades away during the remaining stories, and the last three are written in the romantic fiction style common to Chambers' later work. They are all linked to the preceding stories by their Parisian setting and artistic protagonists.
List of stories
The stories present in the book are:
" The Repairer of Reputations " â€“ A powerful, weird story of egotism and paranoia that carries the imagery of the book's title.
"The Mask" â€“ A dream story of art, love, and uncanny science.
" In the Court of the Dragon " â€“ A man is pursued by a sinister church organist who is after his soul.
"The Yellow Sign" â€“ An artist is troubled by a sinister churchyard watchman who resembles a coffin worm.
"The Demoiselle d'Ys" â€“ A ghost story, the theme of which anticipates H. G. Wells' "The Door in the Wall".
" The Prophets' Paradise " â€“ A sequence of eerie prose poems that develop the style and theme of a quote from the fictional play The King in Yellow that introduces "The Mask".
"The Street of the Four Winds" â€“ An atmospheric tale of an artist in Paris who is drawn to a neighbor's room by a cat; the story ends with a macabre touch.
"The Street of the First Shell" â€“ A war story set in the Paris Siege , 1870.
"The Street of Our Lady of the Fields" â€“ Romantic American bohemians in Paris.
"Rue BarrÃ©e" â€“ Romantic American bohemians in Paris, with a discordant ending that playfully reflects some of the tone of the first story.
The play called The King in Yellow
The imaginary play The King in Yellow has two acts and at least three characters: Cassilda, Camilla, and "The Stranger", who may or may not be the title character. Chambers' story collection excerpts sections from the play to introduce the book as a whole, or individual stories. For example, "Cassilda's Song" comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:
Along the shore the cloud waves break,
The twin suns sink behind the lake,
The shadows lengthen
Strange is the night where black stars rise,
And strange moons circle through the skies,
But stranger still is
Songs that the Hyades shall sing,
Where flap the tatters of the King,
Must die unheard in
Song of my soul, my voice is dead,
Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed
Shall dry and die in
The short story "The Mask" is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:
Camilla: You, sir, should unmask.
Stranger: Indeed?
Cassilda: Indeed it's time. We have all laid aside disguise but you.
Stranger: I wear no mask.
Camilla: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda.) No mask? No mask! [4]
It is also stated, in the "The Repairer of Reputations," that the final moment of the first act involves the character of Cassilda on the streets, screaming in a horrified fashion, "Not upon Us, oh king! Not upon us!". [5]
All of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the "irresistible" revealed truths. "The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect." Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: "If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it [...]" ("The Repairer of Reputations").
Chambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from " The Repairer of Reputations ":
He mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. "The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever," he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King.
A similar passage occurs in "The Yellow Sign", in which two protagonists have read The King in Yellow:
Night fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the fog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and break on the shores of Hali.
Influences

(November 2010)
Chambers borrowed the names Carcosa, Hali, and Hastur from Ambrose Bierce : specifically, his short stories " An Inhabitant of Carcosa " and " HaÃ¯ta the Shepherd ". There is no strong indication that Chambers was influenced beyond liking the names. For example, Hastur is a god of shepherds in "HaÃ¯ta the Shepherd", but is implicitly a location in "The Repairer of Reputations", listed alongside the Hyades and Aldebaran. [6]
Possible influences may include Edgar Allan Poe 's " The Masque of the Red Death ". Its synopsis is similar to Chambers's imaginary play: a masquerade is held by decadent members of the aristocracy. They isolate themselves from the outside world where the Red Death, a plague, reigns supreme. At the end of the masquerade, a stranger appears, wearing a bloodied shroud and a mask figuring a Red Death victim. When the shocked dancers try to unmask him, they find nothing but an empty shroud and a Mask; then they die from the plague, one by one. [7] In both stories, colors have an ominous importance and the strangers are both portents of death and destruction.
Other texts, especially from the symbolist writers, may have influenced Chambers as well: "Le Roi au masque d'or" ("The king in the gold mask"), a short story written by Marcel Schwob â€”a French novelist and a friend of Oscar Wilde â€”was published in 1893 while Chambers was still studying in Paris. In this story, a king rules a city where all inhabitants are masked. One day, a strange blind beggar comes into his palace. After meeting with the beggar, the king, believing he's afflicted by leprosy, feels compelled to remove his mask; he then tears his own eyes out and leaves his city. A beggar now, the former king heads toward the faraway "city of the wretched" but dies before the end of his journey. [8]
It is also possible that the play SalomÃ© by Oscar Wilde , published in 1893, was another symbolist source of inspiration for The King in Yellow. Like The King in Yellow,[ citation needed ] SalomÃ© was originally written in French before being translated; it was then banned in Britain because of its scandalous reputation. Wilde's play in one act involves a queen, a princess, a king, and an ominous prophet clad in camel's hair dress, Iokanaan , whose appearance may bring untold and terrible events. [9] The ominous language used, the drama, and the feeling of unease and expectation, evokes Chambers's play; on page one of SalomÃ©, the moon is described as a "little princess who wears a yellow veil"; on pages three and nine, the young Syrian says, "How pale the princess is! Never have I seen her so pale." On page 16, the young Syrian is named by Salome: his name is Narraboth and he beseeches Salome to avoid looking at Iokanaan and, finally, commits suicide. [10] Marcel Schwob corrected the original French version of SalomÃ© on behalf of Oscar Wilde.[ citation needed ]
Brian Stableford pointed out that the story " The Demoiselle d'Ys " was influenced by the stories of ThÃ©ophile Gautier , such as "Arria Marcella" (1852); both Gautier and Chambers' stories feature a love affair enabled by a supernatural time slip . [11]
Cthulhu Mythos
H.P. Lovecraft read The King in Yellow in early 1927 [12] and included passing references to various things and places from the bookâ€”such as the Lake of Hali and the Yellow Sign â€”in " The Whisperer in Darkness " ( 1931 ), [13] one of his seminal Cthulhu Mythos stories. Lovecraft borrowed Chambers' method of only vaguely referring to supernatural events, entities, and places, thereby allowing his readers to imagine the horror for themselves. The imaginary play The King in Yellow effectively became another piece of occult literature in the Cthulhu Mythos alongside the Necronomicon and others.
In the story, Lovecraft linked the Yellow Sign to Hastur , but from his brief (and only) mention it is not clear what Lovecraft meant Hastur to be. August Derleth developed Hastur into a Great Old One in his controversial reworking of Lovecraft's universe, elaborating on this connection in his own mythos stories. In the writings of Derleth and a few other latter-day Cthulhu Mythos authors, the King in Yellow is an Avatar of Hastur, so named because of his appearance as a thin, floating man covered in tattered yellow robes.[ citation needed ]
In Lovecraft's cycle of horror sonnets, Fungi from Yuggoth, sonnet XXVII "The Elder Pharos" mentions the last Elder One who lives alone talking to chaos via drums: "The Thing, they whisper, wears a silken mask of yellow, whose queer folds appear to hide a face not of this earth...." [14]
In the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game published by Chaosium , the King In Yellow is an avatar of Hastur who uses his eponymous play to spread insanity among humans. He is described as a hunched figure clad in tattered, yellow rags, who wears a smooth and featureless "Pallid Mask." Removing the mask is a sanity-shattering experience; the King's face is described as "inhuman eyes in a suppurating sea of stubby maggot-like mouths; liquescent flesh, tumorous and gelid, floating and reforming."[ attribution needed ]
Although none of the characters in Chambers's book describe the plot of the play, Kevin Ross fabricated a plot for the play within the Call of Cthulhu mythos.[ citation needed ]

Joseph S. Pulver has written nearly 30 tales and poems that are based on and/or include The King in Yellow, Carcosa , and other elements from Chambers' stories. Pulver also edited an anthology of new fiction related to The King in Yellow, titled A Season in Carcosa, released in 2012 by Miskatonic River Press.

The King in Yellow is the title of an expansion to the Lovecraft -themed Arkham Horror adventure board game , involving a troupe of actors who intend to perform the eponymous play. The King himself does not appear, but if the play is performed to its conclusion, it drives the entire population of Arkham insane.

The final boss in Magicka is a powerful being called Assatur (alternative name of Hastur), the King in Yellow, who threatens to destroy the world.
An unabridged copy of the play and a crown referencing this book can be found in Dungeons of Dredmor . They would be useful equipment for a player character who practiced necromancy.
In the role-playing game Dark Souls , there is a hidden non-player character named "Xanthous King Jeremiah." His name, along with the descriptions of his bright yellow clothing, imply a subtle reference to The King in Yellow.
