The Knight and Knave of Swords is a fantasy short story collection by Fritz Leiber featuring his sword and sorcery heroes Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. It is chronologically the seventh and last volume in the complete seven volume edition of the collected stories devoted to the characters. It was first published in hardcover in December 1988 by William Morrow, and in paperback in February 1990 by Ace Books; it was later reissued under the title Farewell to Lankhmar in both hardcover and paperback by White Wolf (1998, 1999); the most recent later paperback edition, from Dark Horse (2008), reverted to the original title. It has been published in the United Kingdom by Grafton (1990, 1991) and Gollancz (2000); the latter adopted the title used by the White Wolf editions. The book has also been gathered together with others in the series into the omnibus edition The Second Book of Lankhmar (2001). The book collects four short stories, the first three originally published in the magazine The Dragon Magazine for December 1977, the collection Heroes and Horrors (1978), and the anthology Heroic Visions (1983). The fourth was originally published as two stories, "The Mouser Goes Below" in the magazine Whispers #23 (1987), and "Slack Lankhmar Afternoon Featuring Hisvet," in the anthology Terry's Universe (1988), which were combined for publication in the collection.
