The novel of Shimotsuma Monogatari has more or less the same plot of the movie, but with much more detail.
The book begins with Momoko talking about her life as a Lolita living in a small town in the Japanese countryside. She is the only Lolita in her town and has no friends, but she doesn't care and believes that her Lolita clothes are all she needs to make her happy. But when she runs out of money, she needs to find a way to get her fix of Baby The Stars Shine Bright, her favorite clothing boutique. She decides to sell some of her father's old bootleg 'Versach' clothes. When Ichiko, a member of an all-girl biker gang finds out about the bootleg apparel, she decides to take a look and is easily impressed with them. Soon she shows up at Momoko's house almost daily to buy stuff for the members of her gang.
The rest of the book goes with the movie fairly well until it comes time for Momoko to show Isobe, the designer for Baby The Stars Shine Bright, the work she did on the dress he needed embroidered. She arrives on time and everyone loves her work, but when it comes time for the photo shoot, there is an accident and the model can not do the shoot. Being the only person there the right size to wear the dress, Ichigo hesitantly agrees to model even though she hates Lolita fashion.
When the members of Ichigo's biker gang find out about her modeling, they are enraged and decide to throw her out of the gang. They plan to challenge her, which means beating her up very badly. Momoko finds out about the challenge and goes to Ichigo's aid. After accidentally scaring the gang out of their minds, Momoko is considered the winner and saves Ichigo, who she secretly believes to be the best friend she could ever have.
Plot
The movie begins with a flash forward of Momoko getting hit by a car while driving a scooter, then shifts to the past to introduce her background and early life.
Momoko, who was born near Kobe , wishes that she had been born in Rococo -era France. Her father, a former small-time gangster, was involved in selling fake brand name clothing. After making a fake "double-brand" he finds himself in trouble with Universal Studios , Versace , and the mob, and so he and Momoko move to his mother's house in the rural town of Shimotsuma .
Momoko must go to Tokyo to shop for her clothes, but constantly finds herself short of money for the expensive trip and the pricey clothes she wants to buy. She decides to sell some of her father's fake Versace products, and meets Ichigo, who answers an advertisement she has placed about selling the clothes. Ichigo is a racy, boyish type who belongs to an all-girl bÅ�sÅ�zoku (motorcycle gang). Gradually, the unlikely pair become friends.
Soon Ichigo needs Momoko's help. Akimi, the leader of Ichigo's gang, is leaving, and as a tribute Ichigo plans to have her coat embroidered. She has heard that there is a legendary embroiderer in Tokyo named Emma (sometimes translated as M.R.) and she persuades Momoko to go there with her.
Although they never find the embroiderer, they do stop at Baby, The Stars Shine Bright , the shop where Momoko buys her frilly Lolita dresses. An assistant notices the beautiful embroidery Momoko has stitched on her bonnet and calls the designer himself to come to look at it. Later in the film, the designer asks Momoko to embroider a sample garment which accidentally came back plain.
Back in Shimotsuma, after an argument, Momoko offers to stitch the embroidery on Ichigo's coat, which she does with great skill.
The final scenes of the film concern a fight between Ichigo and the members of several all-girl motorbike gangs. It is revealed that the crash at the start of the movie occurred when Momoko was rushing to help Ichigo. Momoko does not die, but instead challenges the entire motorbike gang and wins, rescuing Ichigo.
