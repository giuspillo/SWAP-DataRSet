I'd Tell You I Love You, But Then I'd Have to Kill You (2006) is a young-adult fiction novel written by Ally Carter and is the first book in the Gallagher Girls series. In October 2007, a sequel was released titled Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy.
Plot
The Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women is a fairly typical all-girls schoolâ€”that is, if every school teaches advanced martial arts in PE, chemistry always consists of the latest in chemical warfare, and everyone breaks CIA codes for extra credit in computer class. So in truth, while the Gallagher Academy might say itâ€™s a school for geniuses what they really mean is spies. But what happens when a Gallagher Girl falls for a boy who doesnâ€™t have a code name?
Cammie Morgan may be fluent in fourteen languages and capable of killing a man in seven different ways (three of which involve a piece of uncooked spaghetti), but the Gallagher Academy hasnâ€™t prepared her for what to do when she meets an ordinary boy who thinks sheâ€™s an ordinary girl. Sure, she can tap his phone, hack into his computer, and track him through a mall without him ever being the wiser, but can she have a regular relationship with a regular boy who can never know the truth about her? Cammie may be an elite spy in training, but in her sophomore year, sheâ€™s doing something riskier than everâ€”sheâ€™s falling in love. [1]
