Mythago Wood is a fantasy novel written by Robert Holdstock that was published in the United Kingdom in 1984. The conception began as a short story written for the 1979 Milford Writer's Workshop; next a novella of the same name appeared in the September 1981 edition of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. The full-length novel retained the same name and was subsequently released, beginning a series of novels referred to collectively as the "Mythago Wood cycle" or "Ryhope Wood series". Mythago Wood is set in Herefordshire, England in and around a stand of ancient woodland, known as Ryhope Wood. The story involves the internally estranged members of the Huxley family, particularly Stephen Huxley, and his experiences with the enigmatic forest and its magical inhabitants. Mythago Wood is a type of fantasy literature, especially the fantasy subgenre of mythic fiction. It has received critical acclaim because of its prose, forest setting, and its exploration of the philosophical, spiritual, and psychological. Mythago Wood won the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1985.

[8] Each of Gwyneth's incarnations has a varied personality, some dangerous and others alluring, and differing relations with the members of the Huxley family and Harry Keeton.

This man-boar male mythago is a representation of the first hero from earliest myth. The Urscumug was generated purposely by George Huxley. The Urscumug is twice the height of a human and is a malevolent and ancient variation on the woodwose .
Literary significance and criticism
Within the fantasy genre, Mythago Wood has drawn critical attention for a variety of reasons over a span of years. Reviewer Orson Scott Card described it as "for readers who are willing to take the time and effort to let a writer evoke a whole and believable world, peopled with living characters. [9]
Place in the Fantasy Genre
One type of literary analysis of Holdstockâ€™s work compares it to other literature with similar characteristics.
Richard Mathews, a literary scholar, states that The Ryhope wood series is considered to be "one of the landmark fantasy series of the late twentieth century." [10] Another scholar asserts that Holdstockâ€™s work stands apart from â€œgenre fantasyâ€� and that â€œThe sequence as a whole is a central contribution to late-20th-century fantasy.â€� [11] In one study of Tolkien 's work, Holdstock is placed in a quartet of noteworthy fantasy authors including Ursula K. Le Guin , John Crowley and Marion Zimmer Bradley for writing fantasy books that almost have Tolkien's breadth and depth of imagination, and "in some respects surpass Tolkien." [12] Another J. R. R. Tolkien scholar, Michael D. C. Drout , also asserts that Holdstock's fantasy is significant in the fantasy literature genre. This, he says, is because (in the Mythago Wood cycle) Holdstock has created literary arts containing the power and aesthetic standards of Tolkienâ€™s fantasy without being either a "close imitation of" or a "reaction against" Tolkien. Along with Ursula LeGuin, Holdstock is considered to be a worthy inheritor of the fantasy tradition created by Tolkien. [13]
Prose style
A second type of critical praise and analysis focuses on the quality of the writing. Again, Richard Mathews expresses the opinion that Holdstockâ€™s writing in the Mythago Wood cycle is an impressive mixture of poetic style and sensitivity. [10] John Howe, a modern fantasy illustrator, wrote: "Mythago Wood is a wonderful book written with great style, insight and individuality." [14] A decade after Mythago Wood was published, Brian W. Aldiss stated that Robert Holdstock's wonderful Mythago Wood was full of ancient power, unrivaled throughout the decade of the 1980s. [15] Mythago Wood is also noted for its pairing of sexuality and violence, and is noted as â€œan earthy, tactile, deeply mythological tale set in an English wood.â€� [16] In Horror: The 100 Best Books Michael Moorcock states of Mythago Wood: "Holdstock avoids sentimentality ... by offering us tougher questions, moral dilemmas, an imagined world far more complex than anything found in the wood's precursors." [17]
Philosophical & psychological elements
The philosophical and psychological elements of the Mythago Wood cycle have also caused commentary. The mechanism of mythagos being created from the subconscious ties in with Carl Jung â€™s well-developed philosophical understanding of the psyche . The mythagos embody Jungian archetypes since they are dependent on the subconscious, not on distinct memory. Tying in with this philosophy, Kim Newman notes that the series offers â€œmind-stretching meditation on the nature of collective imagination." [18] Nicholas Riddick states "Robert Holdstock's Mythago Wood can be read as a journey into the heartland of the psyche." [19] The story is also considered commonly as an "inward spiral" in which the protagonists undergo cruel and devastating metamorphoses in a difficult setting. [11] Brian Aldiss said that "Ryhope Wood [is] that terrifying metaphor for our mental labyrinths" in which " phylogeny presides over ontogeny " with regards to an individual's history and destiny. [20] Freudian psychology appears in the narrative when Stephen and Christian encounter the Urscumug, who displays characteristics of their father. [21]
Spiritual elements
The interior of Ryhope wood is a pre-Christian British setting in which pagan and shamanistic rituals are common, and one scholar notes that death and mortal remains are prominent and disturbing part of these works. [22] Along the same lines, it is noted that Mythago Wood might convey a more disturbing side of shamanry than other fantasy. [23] One critical study examines the pagan spiritual aspect of Mythago Wood, in particular how "elements of the series' thesis resonate with pagan worldviews." This is not because Mythago Wood is specifically written for Pagans, but because the mechanisms of Ryhope wood defy science and allow for events that are readily recognizable to Pagans. [24]
Subject & setting
The setting of a myth-rich magical Celtic forest itself, along with its existence side-by-side with the modern everyday world, are characteristics of particular interest to critics. For example, in a recent study of the fantasy genre, Mythago Wood and Lavondyss have been recognized as being significant because they are pure fantasy works that take place in an innovative and startlingly ordinary realm. [10] According to one modern Tolkien scholar, Mythago Wood and Lavondyss are two of Holdstockâ€™s best works which, as fantasies, have an internally consistent framework of principles. Notably, these works deal with the traditions of the British Isles with originality and deftness by incorporating its unwritten culture. These elements of culture include the Morris dances , the Green Man , Shamanism, Neolithic tribespeople, and pre-Roman Celtic traditions. [22] The archetypal wilderness of Holdstock is noted as remarkable and followed up by the notion that within the fantasy genre of literature, Mythago Wood and Merlin's Wood have been considered essential reading because "Holdstock is a writer who has traveled deeper into the woods than any other mythic writer." [25] Michael Moorcock finds Mythago Wood notable for focusing on the subject of unity , including both the unity of the landscape and its inhabitants as well as the unity of dreams and the environment. Moorcock notes Mythago Wood is influenced by The Golden Bough , modern anthropology and the writer Arthur Machen . Moorcock also observes common elements between Mythago Wood and Ursula K. Le Guin's low fantasy novel The Beginning Place and George Meredith's poem The Woods of Westermain. [26]

Chronology of works in the Mythago Wood cycle
The order in which the Mythago cycle works were written/published does not necessarily correspond to the order of events within the realm of the Mythago Wood cycle. For example, Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn and the novella The Bone Forest are prequels to Mythago Wood even though they were published at a later date. The novel Merlin's Wood (1994) and short stories in The Bone Forest and Merlin's Wood have little bearing on the events in the Ryhope wood. See the table below for a chronology of events within Ryhope wood.
