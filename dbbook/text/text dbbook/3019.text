Chapter 5: And Finally, Skateboards, Bungee Jumping and Other Failures
In the final chapter of Paulsenâ€™s memoir, Paulsen and his friends experiment with skateboarding , bungee jumping , and other daredevil tricks. The first vignette in the chapter shows Paulsen and his friends killing some time by nailing roller skate wheels to pieces of two-by-six board, creating skateboards; and as readers might guess, the goal of skating becomes to out-do oneâ€™s friends with oneâ€™s skating bravado. Ultimately, Wayne wins the skating bravado contest by hitching a rideâ€”unbeknownst to the driversâ€”hanging on to the back of car bumpers. Wayne hitches all the way to Hutchinson, a town seven miles away, and back. The proof of Wayneâ€™s bravery is featured in a local paper under the headline â€œWild Kids Catch Wild Rides,â€� with a picture of Wayne hanging off the bumper of a chicken truck in Hutchinson.
Another vignette involves Paulsen and his cousin, Harris. Here, Harris uses old tractor tire tubes to bungee jump out of a barnâ€™s hayloft, bouncing into a waspsâ€™ nest, wasps relentlessly following himâ€”up and down, up and down.
The final four pages of the last chapter include multiple vignettes: Wayne crawling into an old refrigerator with M-80s, Orvis jumping through a hoop of fire, Angel experimenting with multiple uses for a full-sized parachute, and Wayne creating a diving bell to explore the Mud River.
