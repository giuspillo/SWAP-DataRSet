The Cloud of Unknowing is an anonymous work of Christian mysticism written in Middle English in the latter half of the 14th century. The text is a spiritual guide on contemplative prayer in the late Middle Ages. The underlying message of this work proposes that the only way to truly "know" God is to abandon all preconceived notions and beliefs or “knowledge” about God and be courageous enough to surrender your mind and ego to the realm of "unknowingness," at which point, you begin to glimpse the true nature of God. Manuscripts of the work are today at British Library and Cambridge University Library.
Evelyn Underhill (1922/2003)
And if we will intentively pray for getting of good, let us cry, either with word or with thought or with desire, nought else nor no more words, but this word â€œGod.â€� For why, in God be all good.. Fill thy spirit with the ghostly bemeaning of it without any special beholding to any of His worksâ€”whether they be good, better, or best of allâ€”bodily or ghostly, or to any virtue that may be wrought in manâ€™s soul by any grace; not looking after whether it be meekness or charity, patience or abstinence, hope, faith, or soberness, chastity or wilful poverty. What recks this in contemplatives?.. they covet nothing with special beholding, but only good God. Do thou.. mean God all, and all God, so that nought work in thy wit and in thy will, but only God. [7]
Middle English original
And yif we wil ententifly preie for getyng of goodes, lat us crie, outher with worde or with thought or with desire, nought elles, ne no mo wordes, bot this worde God. For whi in God ben alle goodes.. Fille thi spirit with the goostly bemenyng of it withoutyn any specyal beholdyng to any of His werkes whether thei be good, betir, or alther best, bodily or goostlyâ€”or to any vertewe that may be wrought in mans soule by any grace, not lokyng after whether it be meeknes or charitÃ©, pacyence or abstynence, hope, feith, or sobirnes, chastitÃ© or wilful povertÃ©. What thar reche in contemplatyves?.. thei coveyte nothing with specyal beholdyng, bot only good God. Do thou.. mene God al, and al God, so that nought worche in thi witte and in thi wile, bot only God. [8]
From a description of how to practice contemplation (from chapters 39 and 40):
When we intend to pray for goodness, let all our thought and desire be contained in the one small word "God." Nothing else and no other words are needed, for God is the epitome of all goodness.. Immerse yourself in the spiritual reality it speaks of yet without precise ideas of God's works whether small or great, spiritual or material. Do not consider any particular virtue which God may teach you through grace, whether it is humility, charity, patience, abstinence, hope, faith, moderation, chastity, or evangelical poverty. For to a contemplative they are, in a sense, all the same.. Let this little word represent to you God in all his fullness and nothing less than the fullness of God. [9]
From elsewhere (chapter 23, The Book of Privy Counseling):
"And so I urge you, go after experience rather than knowledge. On account of pride, knowledge may often deceive you, but this gentle, loving affection will not deceive you. Knowledge tends to breed conceit, but love builds. Knowledge is full of labor, but love, full of rest." [10]
Other works by the same author
In addition to The Cloud of Unknowing and The Book of Privy Counseling, the Cloud author is believed to be responsible for a few other spiritual treatises and translations, including:
Deonise Hid Divinity, a free translation of the Mystical Theology by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite . A vernacular translation of the Mystical Theology was unprecedented; however, it was clearly not widely read, since only two manuscripts survive. [11]
A Letter of Prayer (A Pistle of Prayer), which survives in seven manuscripts. ( Online );
A Letter of Discretion of Stirrings (A Pistle of Discrecioun of Stirings). ( Online, part VI of "The Cell of Self Knowledge" )
It is possible, but doubtful, [11] that he wrote A Treatise of Discernment of Spirits (originally titled A Tretis of Discrecyon of Spirites), a free translation of Sermones di Diversis nos 23-24, by Bernard of Clairvaux , ( Online ).
It is possible, but doubtful, [11] that he wrote A Treatise of the Study of Wisdom that Men Call Benjamin (also called Pursuit of Wisdom, and, in its original, A Tretyse of the Stodye of Wysdome that Men Clepen Beniamyn), an abbreviated and free translation of the Benjamin Minor by Richard of St. Victor ( Online ).
Later influence
The work was not as popular in late medieval England as the works of Richard Rolle or Walter Hilton , perhaps because the Cloud is addressed to solitaries and concentrates on the advanced levels of the mystical path. It is found in only 17 manuscripts. [5] Two Latin translations of the Cloud were made in the late fifteenth century. One was made by Richard Methley , a Carthusian of the Charterhouse of Mount Grace in Yorkshire , and finished in 1491. [12] The another is anonymous. Neither, however, enjoyed wide dissemination. [5]
This work became known to English Catholics in the mid 17th century, when later ascetic and Benedictine mystic, Augustine Baker (1575â€“1641), wrote an exposition on its doctrine (today a transcript of this version of the work dated 1677 is at Ampleforth College ). The original work itself, however, was not published until 1877. English mystic Evelyn Underhill edited an important version of the work in 1922. [1]
The work has become increasingly popular over the course of the twentieth century, with nine English translations or modernisations produced in this period. In particular, the Cloud has influenced recent contemplative prayer practices. The practical prayer advice contained in The Cloud of Unknowing forms a primary basis for the contemporary practice of Centering Prayer , a form of Christian meditation developed by Trappist monks William Meninger , Basil Pennington and Thomas Keating in the 1970s. [13] It also informed the meditation techniques of the English Benedictine John Main . [5]
The contemplation method urged in The Cloud is similar to Buddhist meditation and modern transcendental meditation - see the last paragraph of chapter 7: "If you want to gather all your desire into one simple word that the mind can easily retain, choose a short word rather than a long one. A one-syllable word such as "God" or "love" is best. But choose one that is meaningful to you. Then fix it in your mind so that it will remain there come what may. This word will be your defence in conflict and in peace. Use it to beat upon the cloud of darkness above you and to subdue all distractions, consigning them to the cloud of forgetting beneath you."
