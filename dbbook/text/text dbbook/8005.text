The Fallible Fiend is a fantasy novel written by L. Sprague de Camp, the third book of his Novarian series. It was first published as a two-part serial in the magazine Fantastic for December 1972 and February 1973, and subsequently expanded and revised for book publication. In its original form it won the 1973 British Fantasy Award for short story. The novel was first published in book form as a paperback by Signet Books in 1973; it was later reprinted by Del Rey Books, among other publishers. An E-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form. It has also been translated into German.
Plot summary
On the demonic Twelfth Plane the demon Zdim is drafted for a year's indentured servitude on the human Prime Plane, the demon society having an agreement to provide service to human sorcerers in return for supplies of iron, a raw material it desperately needs.
Zdim is duly summoned to the Prime Plane by the sorcerer Dr. Maldivius of Novaria. There he strives to do his duty, but his demonic literal-mindedness hampers him. Assigned to protect the Sibylline Sapphire from any trespassers, he promptly eats Maldivius' apprentice Grax when the latter intrudes.
Similar misadventures result in the disgusted Maldivius selling his contract, and the demon is passed from one master to another, from circus master Bagardo to the rich widow Roska of Ir, all the while doing his level best to figure out what the muddled humans truly wish of him.
Against all odds he becomes a hero when he recruits aid for the city-state of Ir after it discounts intelligence of an imminent invasion by the cannibal Paaluans. Returning to his home plane early and with extra iron, he resolves never again to leave the comforts of the Twelfth Plane â€” until he realizes how dull it is compared with the picturesque insanity of the human realm...
By internal chronology, The Fallible Fiend is the second story in the Novarian series, coming after the short story " The Emperor's Fan ", which is set centuries before the others, and prior to the Reluctant King trilogy. (The Paaluan invasion of Ir is mentioned in the second and third books of the trilogy, The Clocks of Iraz and The Unbeheaded King , respectively, as an event occurring either recently or some generations past.)
Note: The name of Ir, the subterrranean city-state where much the plot takes place, is simply the Hebrew word for "city" (×¢×™×¨).
Setting
The world of which Novaria is part is a parallel world to Earth , a plane of existence related to ours in that ours constitutes its afterlife . Culturally it bears resemblances to the eras of both Classical Greece and Medieval Europe . The states of Novaria itself are split between competing systems of government, some of them unique, which allows the author to explore various pros and cons of different styles of governance as his hero tours the country.
Innovative features
Adopting the viewpoint of an outsider to comment on the foibles of one's own society has been done before in fiction, notably by Montesquieu in Lettres persanes and Mark Twain in his "Ah Song Hi" letters, but de Camp's use of the device in The Fallible Fiend marks the earliest attempt to do so in the fantasy genre[ citation needed ]. Adapting it to fantasy also permits him to extend it into an outside view of humanity as a whole by an alien being and maintain a fine satirical edge throughout the book. De Camp's demonic protagonist Zdim long remained a uniquely unlikely fantasy hero, as other authors were slow to mine the concept de Camp pioneered.
