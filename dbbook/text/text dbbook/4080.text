The Case of the Late Pig is a crime novel by Margery Allingham, first published 1937, by Hodder & Stoughton. It is the eighth novel featuring the mysterious Albert Campion and his butler/valet/bodyguard Magersfontein Lugg.
Plot summary
As Lugg is reading aloud the obituaries one morning, he comes across one for an old school nemesis of Campion. Remarkably, an anonymous letter inviting Campion to the funeral has also appeared in the morning post. R.I. â€œPigâ€� Peters is dead. So says the doctor that treated him.
Five months later, Campion receives a panicked call from a friend, something about a murder. Campion drives down to the friendâ€™s home where her father reveals the most assuredly dead body of R.I. â€œPigâ€� Peters, his head caved in no more than 12 hours earlier.
Amazingly enough, some of the visitors from Peters' first funeral also appear, along with some not-so-grieving acquaintances of the late Pig. The little village is becoming very crowded.
Now begins Campionâ€™s search, which leads to a missing body, a grisly scarecrow and one too many beers for Lugg before he discovers the madman that planned more than a few murders.
This is the only story told from Campion's point of view.
