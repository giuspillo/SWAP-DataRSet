Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again (also referred to as DK2) is a three-issue, limited series comic book about Batman, written and drawn by Frank Miller and colored by Lynn Varley.

His return brings him into conflict with the dictatorial rulers of the American Empire, as well as an enigmatic enemy from his past.

Synopsis
Frank Miller's cover to The Dark Knight Strikes Again #1.
After going underground, Batman (Bruce Wayne) and his young sidekick Catgirl ( Carrie Kelley â€” Robin from The Dark Knight Returns ) train an army of "Batboys" (the former Mutants and other recruits) to save the world from a police dictatorship led by Lex Luthor . In a series of raids on government facilities, Batman's soldiers release other superheroesâ€”including Atom , Flash and Plastic Man â€”from captivity. Elongated Man is recruited and Green Arrow is already working with Batman.
Superman , Wonder Woman , and Captain Marvel have been forced to work for the US government and their loved ones are being held hostage. Superman is ordered by the "President" (in fact a computer-generated front for Lex Luthor and Brainiac ) to stop Batman. He confronts Wayne at the Batcave , but Batman and the other superheroes defeat him. Meanwhile, Batman's raids have been noticed by the media. After being banned for years, the freed superheroes have recaptured the public imagination and have become a fad among the youth. At a pop concert by "The Superchix", Batman and the other heroes make a public appearance urging their fans to rebel against the oppressive government.
During this time, rogue vigilante Question spies on Luthor's plans and types a journal to record the misdeeds of those in power. Question tries to convince the Martian Manhunter â€”now an aged, bitter, near-powerless figure with his mind filled with Luthor's nanotechnologyâ€”to stand up against Superman and the government. Question and Martian Manhunter are attacked by a supernatural man resembling the Joker , but who is seemingly invulnerable to injury. Martian Manhunter sacrifices his life and Question is rescued by Green Arrow. The mysterious man escapes to kill other superheroes including Guardian and Creeper , stealing their costumes and wearing them..
An extraterrestrial monster lands in Metropolis and begins to destroy the city. Batman is convinced that it is an attempt to lure him and his allies out of hiding and does not respond, dismissing Flash's appeal that they are supposed to save lives. Batman's opinion is that it is too risky to save the lives of the populace. Superman and Captain Marvel fight the monster which is Brainiac, who coerces Superman into defeat using the bottled Kryptonian city of Kandor as leverage, to crush the people's faith in superheroes. Captain Marvel is killed defending citizens from the carnage but Superman is saved when his daughter Lara appears. She has been carefully hidden since birth but now that the government knows she exists, they demand that she is handed over.
Deciding that Batman and his methods are the only way, Superman, Wonder Woman and Lara join him. Lara pretends to hand herself over to Brainiac. Atom slips into the bottle and frees the Kandorians, who use their combined heat vision to destroy Brainiac. Then the superheroes destroy the dictatorship's power source and incite a revolution. Batman allows himself to be captured and tortured by Luthor to learn his plans. Luthor has launched satellites to destroy most of the world's population and leave him with a more manageable number of people. The Green Lantern destroys the satellites and trillions of dollars of Luthor's weapons by wrapping a giant fist around the Earth. Luthor is killed by the son of Hawkman . Batman had planned this action and approves of it, but Flash is horrified.
Returning to the Batcave, Batman receives a communication from Carrie, who is being attacked by the Joker-like man who is now wearing a Robin costume. Batman arrives and recognizes the man as Dick Grayson , the first Robin who Batman fired long ago. Grayson has been genetically manipulated and has a powerful healing factor and shape-shifting ability, but is criminally insane. As Batman and Grayson contemptuously recall their bleak history together, Batman drops him through a trapdoor into a miles-deep crevasse filled with lava, while Elongated Man rescues Carrie. Grayson clings onto a ledge, climbs out of the chasm and faces Batman. When Grayson remains virtually unharmed by everything Batman throws at him, Batman hurls himself and Grayson into the chasm. Grayson falls into the lava and is completely disintegrated. Superman rescues Batman at the last minute as the Batcave explodes and takes him to Carrie in the Batmobile.

Critical reception and sales
The Dark Knight Strikes Again received mixed to negative reviews. Grovel.org.uk gave The Dark Knight Strikes Again two stars out of five, and said that it "reads as a thunderous artillery barrage, all smoke and noise, lacking in nuance". [3] Claude LalumiÃ¨re of The Montreal Gazette gave the series a mixed review and said, "the script lacks the emotional nuances of its predecessor, and ... the artwork is rushed and garish", and that it "has considerable chutzpah, but its careless execution is regrettable". [4] Roger Sabin of The Guardian wrote that the series has "flashes of brillianceâ€”few can control page layouts like Millerâ€”but in general the idea of the ironic superhero seems rather dated." [5]
The second issue of DK2 was ranked third in sales for the January 2002 period with pre-order sales of 155,322. [6]
