Where's Wally Now? (called Find Waldo Now and later Where's Waldo Now? in the US) was the second Where's Wally? book. It was first published in 1988. In the book Wally travels through time as he visits many different locations and events. He also loses a book on each page, which the reader has to find. The book was re-released in October 1997 in a special edition where Wally was moved in each picture and additional characters were added for the reader to find (Woof, Wizard Whitebeard, Wenda, Odlaw, the Wally Watchers and others).
