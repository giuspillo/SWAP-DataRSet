Plot Summary
Dan Barron, a Terran spaceport technician, has begun having visions that interfere with his work. After he causes a major accident, Barron is reassigned to a minor diplomatic mission to teach lens griding to the locals. His guide is Lerrys Montray, who unbeknownst to Barron, is half Terran.
In the Hellers Mountains, the isolated Storn family estate of High Windward has come under attack from a bandit colorfully named Brynat Scarface. He has forced one of the Storn daughters to marry him, but is unable to take full control of the castle because the Lord of Storn lies in a trance behind a telepathic force field.
Storn has made telepathic contact with both Barron, causing his visions, and his sister Melitta, and instructs them both to rendesvous at the ancient city of Carthon. While escaping the castle, Melitta calls on the assistance of Sharra, the mythical chained goddess of forges and fires.
Barron, Lerrys, and their party make their way to one of the mountain fire stations. On the trail, Barron also has a vision of Sharra. Now merged with Storn, he recognizes the beginnings of a Ghost Wind, which disorients all who come in contact. The party takes shelter, but Barron uses the opportunity to escape to Carthon.
Barron and Melitta meet, and Melitta realizes that her brother has taken over Barronâ€™s mind. They make their way to Aldaran to request assistance. They are welcomed by Desideria Leynier, and later meet with Kermiac Aldaran. Alderan refuses to support their cause, but Desideria suggests she can use the Sharra Matrix on their behalf. Barron is accidentally exposed to a telepathic damper, separating him from Storn.
Desideria, Barron and Melitta return to the Storn lands. With the assistance of the mysterious Forge Folk , Desideria uses Sharra to destroy the bandits. Barron decides to remain with Melitta.

The starstone used by Storn of Storn is described as a crystal in the literal shape of a star. No other book describes a startstone as a literal star.
Based on this book, Desideria Storn is the only human in Darkover's history to have ever handled the Sharra matrix safely, and without unintended consequences.
