Reception
Ben Rogers of The Independent described the story as "both abstract and particular, poetic and prosaic, surreal and mundane", and wrote that the ideas of the novel will appeal to philosophers and scientists alike, as well as to both classicist and fans of modern literature. Rogers continued: "Yet beyond the learning so wittily displayed, there is something deeper that might speak to anyone: a voyage around memory and death, myth and disillusionment. By the end, Nooteboom has shown himself a master of ironic wisdom, but also of elated, elegiac feeling. Intricately composed and finely translated, The Following Story will still be delivering after many readings - and on the first it is funny as well as affecting." [1]
