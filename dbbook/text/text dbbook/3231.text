Woman in the Mists: The Story of Dian Fossey and the Mountain Gorillas of Africa is a 1987 biography of the conservationist Dian Fossey, who studied and lived among the mountain gorillas of Rwanda. It is written by the Canadian author Farley Mowat, himself a conservationist and author of the book Never Cry Wolf.
Plot
Dian Fossey worked in the United States in a children's hospital until she decided to become a field anthropologist in Africa. Mowat says this decision illustrates the strength of character that made her famous and that may also have led to her death. In 1960 she gained an interview with Louis Leakey , the famous anthropologist, who encouraged her to study the mountain gorillas of Central Africa at first hand. She accepted this advice against the wishes of her friends and family.
At first, it seemed that she was following the path defined by Jane Goodall , and would become a successful scientist. However, she soon became passionately interested in the cause of preserving the mountain gorillas. An outspoken woman, she made no attempt to disguise her hatred and contempt for poachers and hunters. In December 1986 she was murdered in her African camp. Although the book does not delve into the subject in depth, Mowat speculates that a disgruntled poacher may have been hired to kill her by people opposed to her crusade to preserve the gorillas.
Major Themes
Farley Mowat is highly sympathetic to Fossey's interest in preserving the gorillas. He gives a vivid and convincing portrait of her intense feelings, without concealing that she had a stubborn and difficult personality. She became bitter, with no intimate friends, and her single-mindedness may have contributed to her death. A secondary theme is the importance of preserving the mountain gorillas, which accords with Mowat's own interests as a conservationist.
