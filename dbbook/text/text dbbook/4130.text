The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a non-fiction book by William L. Shirer chronicling the general history of Nazi Germany from 1932 to 1945. It was first published in 1960, by Simon & Schuster in the United States, where it won a National Book Award. It was a bestseller in both the U.S. and Europe, and a critical success outside Germany, where harsh criticism stimulated sales. Academic historians were generally negative. Rise and Fall is based upon captured Third Reich documents, the available diaries of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, General Franz Halder, and of the Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano, evidence and testimony from the Nuremberg trials, British Foreign Office reports, and the author's recollection of six years reporting on the Third Reich for newspapers, the United Press International (UPI), and CBS Radio —terminated by Nazi Party censorship in 1940.

Content and themes
The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a comprehensive historical interpretation of the Nazi era, positing that German history logically proceeded from Martin Luther to Adolf Hitler ; [3] [a] [ page needed ] that Hitlerâ€™s ascension to power was an expression of German national character, not of totalitarianism as an ideology that was internationally fashionable in the 1930s. [4] [5] [6] Author William L. Shirer summarised his perspective: "...the course of German history... made blind obedience to temporal rulers the highest virtue of Germanic man, and put a premium on servility." [7] This reportorial perspective[ clarification needed ], the Sonderweg interpretation of German history (special path or unique course) was then common in American scholarship . Yet, despite extensive footnotes and references, some academic critics consider its interpretation of Nazism flawed. [8] The book also includes (identified) speculation, such as the theory that SS Chief Heinrich MÃ¼ller afterward joined the NKVD of the USSR .

Success and acclaim
In the U.S., where it was published 17 October 1960, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich sold more than one million hardcover copies, two-thirds via the Book of the Month Club , and more than one million paperback copies. It won the 1961 National Book Award for Nonfiction [1] and the Carey-Thomas Award for non-fiction. [9] In 1962, the Reader's Digest magazine serialization reached some 12 million additional readers. [10] [11] In a New York Times Book Review , Hugh Trevor-Roper praised it as "a splendid work of scholarship, objective in method, sound in judgment, inescapable in its conclusions." [12] The book sold well in Britain, France, Italy, [13] and in West Germany , because of its international recognition, bolstered by German editorial attacks. [14]
Both its recognition by journalists as a great history book and its popular success surprised Shirer [15] and the publisher commissioned a first printing of merely 12,500 copies. More than fifteen years after the end of the Second World War , neither Shirer nor the publisher anticipated much popular interest in Adolf Hitler (1889â€“1945) or Nazi Germany (1933â€“45).
Criticism
Whereas nearly all American journalists praised the book, scholars were split. Some acknowledged Shirer's achievement but most condemned it. [9] The harshest criticism came from those who disagreed with the Sonderweg or "Luther to Hitler" thesis.
Klaus Epstein listed what he contended were "four major failings": a crude understanding of German history; a lack of balance, leaving important gaps; no understanding of a modern totalitarian regime; and ignorance of current scholarship of the Nazi period. [15] Shirer is, however, far more neutral in his tone compared to Alan Bullock, and Shirer lived and worked as a reporter in the Third Reich until Germany declared war on the United States in December 1941.
Elizabeth Wiskemann concluded in a review that the book was "not sufficiently scholarly nor sufficiently well written to satisfy more academic demands... It is too long and cumbersome... Mr Shirer, has, however compiled a manual... which will certainly prove useful." [16]
Forty years later, historian Richard J. Evans , author of The Third Reich Trilogy (2003 to 2008), conceded that Rise and Fall is a "readable general history of Nazi Germany" and that "there are good reasons for [its] success." Evans contended that Shirer worked outside of the academic mainstream and that Shirer's account was not informed by the historical scholarship of the time (1960). [17]
In West Germany, the "Luther to Hitler" interpretation was almost universally rejected in favor of the view that Nazism was simply one instance of totalitarianism that arose in various countries. Gavriel Rosenfeld asserted in 1994 that Rise and Fall had been unanimously condemned by German historians in the 1960s, and considered dangerous to relations between America and West Germany, as it might inflame anti-German sentiments in the United States.
