Nightmare in Pink is the second novel in the Travis McGee series written by John D. McDonald. In it, McGee is asked by a friend from his military days to help his sister Nina in the investigation of her fiance's death and the large sum of money involved. The book's title is a reference to the inclusion of hallucinogenic drugs as a plot device in the climax. Much of the action takes place in New York City and upstate New York, a departure from McGee's usual haunts in Florida.
