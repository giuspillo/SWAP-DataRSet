The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke,, first published in 2001, is a collection of almost all science fiction stories written by ArthurÂ C. Clarke: it includes 114 in all arranged in order of publication, "Travel by Wire!" in 1937 through to "Improving the Neighbourhood" in 1999. The story "Improving The Neighbourhood" has the distinction of being the first fiction published in the journal Nature. The titles "Venture to the Moon" and "The Other Side of the Sky", are not stories but the series titles for groups of six interconnected stories, each story with its own title. This collection is missing the story "When the Twerms Came" which appears in his other collections "More Than One Universe" and "The View from Serendip". This edition contains a foreword by Clarke written in 2000, where he speculates on the science fiction genre in relation to the concept of short stories. Furthermore, many of the stories have a short introduction about its publication history or its literary nature. In addition to the printed edition, an audio edition was published by Fantastic Audio in 2001. The audio edition, comprising five volumes, runs nearly fifty hours.

Previous Appearances in Book Form
Of the above 114 pieces, 95 make up complete Clarke's six major short collections published during his life. These are distributed as follows (all cross-references with the above list are noted):
"Expedition to Earth" (1953, 11 stories: nos. 7, 12, 14, 19-21, 28, 31, 32-33, 39)
"Reach for Tomorrow" (1956, 12: nos. 5, 8-9, 11, 13, 18, 23-24, 26, 36-38)
"Tales from the White Hart" (1957, 15: nos. 25, 42, 45-46, 49, 57-64, 66-67)
"The Other Side of the Sky" (1958, 24: nos. 15-16, 34-35, 41, 44, 47-48, 51-56, 65, 69-74, 76-78)
"Tales of Ten Worlds" (1962, 15: nos. 27, 75, 79-89, 91, 93)
"The Wind from the Sun" (1972, 18: nos. 90, 92, 94-109)
Please note that nos. 50 and 68 above are "not" short stories but two cycles of six pieces each.
Later collections consist mostly of previously collected material, with the following exceptions (all cross-references with the above list are noted):
"The Best of Arthur C. Clarke: 1937-1971" (1973, 4 "new" stories: nos. 1, 3, 6, 10)
"The Sentinel" (1983, 2: no. 22)
"The Wind from the Sun" (1987 edition, 3: nos. 110, 111)
"Tales from Planet Earth" (1989, 3: nos. 40, 43, 113)
As can be seen, of these 12 "new stories", 10 are reprinted in "The Collected Stories". The missing ones are a movie outline of 'The Songs of Distant Earth' (from "The Sentinel"; this is "not" the short story of the same name) and a short sketch titled 'When the Twerms Came' which originally appeared in Clarke's non-fiction book "The View from Serendip" (1978) and was later reprinted in the 1987 edition of "The Wind from the Sun".
For the rest nine pieces (2, 4, 17, 29, 30, 112, 114-116) this is either first appearance in book form at all or first appearance in a book by Arthur C. Clarke. There are, however, two exceptions. 'The Lion of Comarre' (17), although published in magazine as early as 1949, first appeared in book form in 1968, in an omnibus edition together with Clarke's early novel "Against the Fall of the Night" (1953). 'The Steam-powered Word-Processor" (112) had previously appeared in Clarke's 'science-fictional autobiography' "Astounding Days" (1989).
