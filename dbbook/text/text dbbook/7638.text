The Killing Machine is a science fiction novel by American writer Jack Vance, the second in his "Demon Princes" series, in which Kirth Gersen, having brought arch-villain Malagate the Woe to justice, sets his sights on Kokor Hekkus, another of the Demon Princes. The name Kokor Hekkus, which means "killing machine" in the language of the planet Thamber, does not refer to Hekkus's own predilection for homicide, but to his fondness for horrific and murderous devices, including the giant robotic executioner that first gained him his nickname.

The Killing Machine ( 1964 ) is a science fiction novel by American writer Jack Vance , the second in his " Demon Princes " series, in which Kirth Gersen , having brought arch-villain Malagate the Woe to justice, sets his sights on Kokor Hekkus, another of the Demon Princes. [1] The name Kokor Hekkus, which means "killing machine" in the language of the planet Thamber, does not refer to Hekkus's own predilection for homicide, but to his fondness for horrific and murderous devices, including the giant robotic executioner that first gained him his nickname.
Plot summary
To hone his skills, Gersen spends time as a " weasel ", a police spy in the lawless Beyond , and is sent on a mission in which Kokor Hekkus intercepts a â€œMr Hoskinsâ€� with license to kill if necessary. Mr Hoskins is killed, though not by Gersen, who recovers two pieces of paper that were being exchanged. One paper provides information on how to become a â€œhormagaunt,â€� an undying monster that steals children and lives on the mythical planet Thamber, and the other paper contains technical specifications that Gersen does not understand.
Gersen is made aware that Billy Windle was Kokor Hekkus. He then learns that Hekkus is masterminding a series of kidnappings. The victims are taken to Interchange, a planet in the Beyond, where exchanges between kidnappers and ransomers are facilitated. Gersen learns that the latest victims are the children of a high-ranking Fellow of the powerful Institute, Duschane Audmar, who must remain aloof under all circumstances. Gersen convinces him to underwrite a fact-finding mission to learn more of Hekkusâ€™s activities and to ransom the children. [2]
Gersen learns that Hekkus accumulates funds to ransom a young woman named Alusz Iphigenia Eperje-Tokay who claims to be from Thamber; she fled her homeworld when Hekkus became interested in her and settled on Interchange as her only refuge, since even he would not dare interfere with the organization. She had set her ransom at 10 billion SVU . Hekkus raised the sum by kidnapping the loved ones of the Oikumeneâ€™s hundred-wealthiest citizens, ransoming them for a hundred million apiece.
Gersen also meets Myron Patch, an engineer from Krokinole . Patch had built Hekkus a many-legged walking â€œfortâ€� resembling a giant centipede, but when Hekkus was dissatisfied with the result, Patch refused to refund the money already paid, and was kidnapped and shipped to Interchange to recover the sum. Gersen ransoms him as well as the Audmar children, and temporarily takes a controlling interest in his engineering company.
He determines to lure Hekkus within his reach, and has ideas how to correct the faults in its walking mechanism. Gersen demands more money by Hekkusâ€™s agent Seuman Otwal for the alterations, but when it is time to deliver the completed fort, Gersen captured and ordered to repay the money; when he cannot, he is dispatched to Interchange.
While there, Gersen sees an old newspaper article that identifies â€œMr Hoskinsâ€� as a senior bank official. He recalls the cryptic fragment of paper he recovered earlier and surmises that it describes marks used to authenticate banknotes. He forges enough money to free himself and returns to ransom Alusz Iphigenia. The money goes to her (minus Interchange's fee) â€“ and since she is uninterested, Gersen becomes fabulously wealthy.
Gersen hopes that Alusz Iphigenia will be able to guide him to Thamber. She has no knowledge of astrogation but is able to complete a nursery rhyme that allows Gersen to deduce the planet's location.
Thamber is home to a quasi-medieval culture with barbarian tribes into whose hands Gersen and Alusz Iphigenia fall. He fights the leader of a war-band to save her from sexual slavery, and they accompany the warriors to Kokor Hekkusâ€™s castle. There the barbarians easily defeat Hekkusâ€™s foot soldiers, but then Patch's mechanical fort appears. It mimics one of Thamber's greatest terrors, an animal called the dnazd, and the barbarians flee in panic before it. Gersen, however, had foreseen the possibility of facing Patch's creation and had installed an Achilles heel . He disables the war machine and takes its crew prisoner, in the process noting that one of the men aboard, Franz Paderbush, resembles Seuman Otwal and also Billy Windle, in height and build.
He takes the fort to the castle of Sion Trumble, at one time Alusz Iphigeniaâ€™s fiancÃ©. Trumble offers the services of a friend who knows Kokor Hekkus, but the man denies that he is Paderbush. Gersen has his suspicions and allows his prisoner to escape, but then forces his way into Trumbleâ€™s private quarters. There he finds Paderbush in the process of transforming himself into Trumble, for they are one and the same, and both are alter-egos of Kokor Hekkus. Hekkus has no face, having concealed his hideous un-face beneath a series of masks. Gersen identifies himself, reminding Hekkus of the Mount Pleasant raid in which his home was destroyed and nearly all of his family killed, and after giving him a few seconds for the news to sink in, executes him. He then returns to the Oikumene accompanied by Alusz Iphigenia, promising to send ships to bring Thamber back with the rest of humanity.
