My Cat Likes to Hide in Boxes is a very popular New Zealand children’s book, which has also attained popularity in the United Kingdom and Canada. It was written by Eve Sutton and Lynley Dodd, cousins-by-law who are both New Zealand-born. The book was first published in 1974. According to Dodd, the book is based upon the "Dodd family cat, Wooskit, who, like all cats, liked to hide in boxes, supermarket bags, cupboards and hidey-holes of all kinds. " The book itself consists of descriptions of other cats from other countries, all followed by the phrase “but my cat likes to hide in boxes. ” After the book's publication, Eve Sutton went on to write books for older children. Lynley Dodd, however, continued to write for younger children—which eventually led to her famous Hairy Maclary series of children’s books.
