Parable of the Talents is the second in a series of science fiction novels written by Octavia E. Butler and published in 1998.
Plot
Parable of the Talents (1998) (the sequel to Parable of the Sower ) tells the story of how, as the U.S. continues to fall apart, the protagonist's community is attacked and taken over by a bloc of religious fanatics who inflict brutal atrocities. The novel is a harsh indictment of religious fundamentalism, and has been compared in that respect to Margaret Atwood 's The Handmaid's Tale . [2]
Proposed third Parable novel
Butler had planned to write a third Parable novel, tentatively titled Parable of the Trickster, which would have focused on the community's struggle to survive on a new planet. She began this novel after finishing Parable of the Talents, and mentioned her work on it in a number of interviews, but at some point encountered a writer's block . She eventually shifted her creative attention, resulting in Fledgling , her final novel.
