Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 is a 2005 book by historian Tony Judt, the Director of New York University's Erich Maria Remarque Institute. The book examines the history of Europe from the end of World War II in 1945 up to 2005. The book has won considerable praise for its breadth and comprehensiveness. The New York Times Book Review listed it as one of the ten best books of 2005. It won the 2006 Arthur Ross Book Award for the best book published on international affairs. As is made clear in the introduction, the author makes no attempt to expound any grand theory or "overarching theme" for contemporary European history, aiming to avoid narrative fallacies by plainly retelling the entire scope of European history in that period, to let what themes do exist become self-apparent.
