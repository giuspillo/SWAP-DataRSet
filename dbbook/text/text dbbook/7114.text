Plot summary
Lupe dy Cazaril, a castillar (a knight or minor baron ), returns home to the Royacy (Kingdom) of Chalion a broken man, though he is only in his mid-thirties. "Caz", as he is known to his friends, had defended a castle during a long siege, only to be ordered to surrender it. Afterward, a jealous enemy had seen to it that he was not ransomed (as were the rest of his men), but sold into slavery, spending 19 months as a galley slave before finally escaping.
His old noble patroness finds a use for him as a tutor for her granddaughter, the Royesse (Princess) Iselle, half-sister to the king, and her companion, Lady Betriz. Despite his ardent desire to live a safely low-profile, peaceful life, Caz finds himself drawn into a strange journey of dangers both spiritual and temporal as he seeks to dispel the debilitating curse that hangs over the royal family of Chalion.

The Curse of Chalion is noted for its focus on religion and metaphysics. This is not only a novel about self-sacrifice and redemption, but also a piece of speculative theological fiction which closely examines the relationship between free will , fate , and divine intervention.
The five gods of the Chalion world are developed original characters that follow strict rules rather than abstract entities with nebulous powers. Because the Gods can work only through the will of a consenting human there is a complex consideration of the problems of free will.

Chalion is a looking-glass version of the kingdom of Castile and LeÃ³n , and the novel is loosely based on the lives of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon , the unifiers of Spain . However, the story of The Curse of Chalion is not simply a retelling of the lives of Isabella and Ferdinand, and Chalion is not simply Castile. The story takes quite a different path from the historical one, and the major characters are distinct personalities, not simply versions of historical people.
Iselle's mother Ista, heroine of the sequel Paladin of Souls , is based on Isabella of Portugal . Iselle's father Roya (King) Ias is based on John II of Castile , whose favorite Alvaro de Luna inspired Bujold's Arvol dy Lutez. Iselle's half-brother Orico represents Henry IV of Castile , who was called "the Impotent", and her full brother Teidez corresponds to Alfonso de las Asturias . The geography is likewise based on that of the Iberian Peninsula in the 15th centuryâ€”but mirrored, north for south. Chalion is Castile ; Ibra is Aragon and Valencia ; South Ibra is Catalonia ; Brajar is Portugal ; the Roknari princedoms are Al-Andalus ; and Darthaca is France . [2]
