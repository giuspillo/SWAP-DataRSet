The Red Box is the fourth Nero Wolfe detective novel by Rex Stout. Prior to its first publication in 1937 by Farrar & Rinehart, Inc. , the novel was serialized in five issues of The American Magazine (December 1936 – April 1937). Together with The League of Frightened Men, it was collected in The Nero Wolfe Omnibus (1944) by the World Publishing Company of Cleveland, Ohio.
Plot introduction
I never knew a plaguier case. We have all the knowledge we need, and not a shred of presentable evidence. Unless the red box is found â€” are we actually going to be forced to send Saul to Scotland or Spain or both? Good heavens! Are we so inept that we must half encircle the globe to demonstrate the motive and the technique of a murder that happened in our own office in front of our eyes? Pfui!
â€” Nero Wolfe in The Red Box, chapter 14
Wolfe and Archie investigate the death of a model who ate a piece of poisoned candy. One of the suspects begs Wolfe to handle his estate and especially the contents of a certain red box. Wolfe is at first concerned about a possible conflict of interest, but feels unable to refuse when the man dies in his office before telling Wolfe where to find the red box. The police naturally think that he told Wolfe somewhat more before dying.
This novel presents the series' first instance of a murder taking place in Wolfe's office.
James Schucker illustrated The Red Box for its
appearance in five issues of The American Magazine,
beginning in December 1936.
The novel opens with Nero Wolfe confronted by a client, Llewellyn Frost, who is pressuring him to leave the his home to investigate a crime scene. Frost has hired Wolfe to investigate the death of Molly Lauck, a model who died after eating a poisoned Jordan almond from a box of assorted candies. Frost wants to ensure that his ortho-cousin Helen is freed from the employment of Boyden McNair, the owner of the fashion boutique where Lauck died. Wolfe reluctantly agrees to leave the brownstone after Frost produces a letter signed by the directors of the Metropolitan Orchid Show urging him to do so. Wolfe and Archie subsequently meet and discuss the matter with McNair himself, who is noticeably agitated and distressed by events.
Following this, Wolfe and Archie interview the other models who were with Lauck when she died, Thelma Mitchell and Helen Frost. They say that Lauck had stolen the box of candy as a prank, but didnâ€™t know where she got it. Although the interview is seemingly unhelpful, Wolfe is intrigued when Helen Frost indicates she knew the contents of the box despite apparently having never seen or handled it. Following the interview Llewellyn Frost, who has romantic feelings for his cousin and believes that Wolfe intends to incriminate her, tries to terminate his contract with Wolfe, but Wolfe refuses to drop the matter without being paid his full fee. Despite the efforts of Llewellyn Frost, his blustering father Dudley and Helenâ€™s mother Calida, Wolfe refuses to budge.
Having heard the news of Wolfe taking the unprecedented step of visiting a crime scene himself, Inspector Cramer arrives to try and find out what Wolfe has discovered. Although Wolfe offers little to Cramer, he makes a suggestion: the next day, Cramer and Archie gather the people of interest in the case and one-by-one offer them a chocolate from a box similar to that which contained the poisoned item that killed Molly Lauck. Making note of who selects what, Archie notes that Boyden McNairâ€™s response is different to the others in that he goes to select a Jordan almond, as the victim did, but then reacts skittishly to the chocolate.
Fearing that Wolfe is about to experience a "relapse" that will draw his attention away from the case, Archie arranges for Helen Frost to come to the brownstone, where Wolfe challenges her regarding her earlier falsehood. Reluctantly, Helen admits that she knew what the contents of the box of candy were, and that the expensive jewellery she wears was given to her by Boyden McNair, who displays a particular fondness towards her. Helen, who considers McNair an uncle due to his long-standing friendship with her mother, believes it is because she reminds McNair of his long-deceased daughter, Glenna, who would have been Helenâ€™s age. Wolfe learns that Helen is only weeks away from her 21st birthday, at which point a trust fund managed by her uncle, Dudley Frost, reverts to her. Wolfeâ€™s interview with Helen is interrupted by Llewellyn Frost, his lawyer Benjamin Leach, and Perren Gebert, another family friend of the Frosts who has designs of marriage towards Helen.
Later, Boyden McNair meets with Wolfe. He confesses that the box of candy had been intended for him and that he suspects that someone is trying to kill him, although he refuses to say who that might be. He declares that he has made Wolfe the executor of his estate, which includes a red leather box that contains information concerning dealings in his past that he regrets. Before McNair can say where the red box is, however, he is suddenly struck down and killed by poison in a tampered bottle of aspirins he has been taking.
Despite Wolfe's original contract being voided on McNair's death, Helen Frost â€” who deeply loved McNair as an uncle and is heartbroken by his death â€” hires Wolfe to locate the murderer. Wolfe determines that the red box will most likely reveal the culprit, and orders it found. As executor of McNairâ€™s estate, he sends Saul Panzer, Orrie Cather, Fred Durkin and Johnny Keems to McNairâ€™s cottage in the country to search the grounds for the box and to keep the police out should they attempt to interfere. Wolfe learns that by the conditions of her trust, if anything were to happen to Helen Frost her inheritance would go to Llewellyn Frost.
Later that night, the operatives at the cottage catch Perren Gebert trying to break in and retrieve something. Archie is sent to collect Gebert and bring him to Wolfe for questioning, but by that point the authorities learn of the existence of the cabin and attempt to search for the red box in it. Archie manages to prevent them from doing so, but is forced to surrender Gebert to their custody. While the police are unable to get any useful information from Gebert, Cramer reveals to Archie that Gebert has been receiving monthly payments of $60,000 from Helen Frostâ€™s trust fund. The next night, after being released from custody Perren Gebert is murdered with a nitrobenzene trap set in his car.
As Cramer is confronting Wolfe about the case, Saul Panzer arrives with a package that prompts Wolfe to have the Frost family and the police summoned to his office in order that he might expose the murderer. Once everyone has arrived, Wolfe reveals that Helen Frost is in fact Glenna McNair, the daughter of Boyden McNair. It was in fact Calida Frostâ€™s daughter Helen who died years before, but as the fortune that Helen would inherit would then go to Dudley and Llewellyn's side of the family, Calida Frost bought Glenna from the then-impoverished Boyden McNair and raised her as Helen. Bitterly regretting what he had done ever since, McNair proceeded to make his fortune, formed an attachment with Helen/Glenna and intimated that he was intending to reveal to truth; Calida Frost killed him to prevent this. Perren Gebert, who knew of the arrangement, had been blackmailing Calida to keep the secret and intended to use this to force her consent to his plans to marry Helen/Glenna. Calida murdered him to keep him silent. Wolfe produces the red box that he claims holds the proof of his accusations; after she looks inside, Calida Frost commits suicide with a bottle of cyanide .
Afterwards, Wolfe reveals that the red box he used is a mock-up; the real box has not been found. Shattered by what she has learned about herself and her family, Glenna McNair has fled to the country, but Wolfe points out to Llewellyn Frost that the fact that they are not in fact cousins and his newfound fortune should eventually help warm her feelings towards him. The actual red box is eventually found in Boyden McNairâ€™s boyhood home in Scotland with plenty of evidence to support Wolfeâ€™s theories, but as Archie notes, "by that time Calida Frost was already buried".
The unfamiliar word
"Nero Wolfe talks in a way that no human being on the face of the earth has ever spoken, with the possible exception of Rex Stout after he had a gin and tonic," said Michael Jaffe , executive producer of the A&E TV series, A Nero Wolfe Mystery . [1] Nero Wolfe's erudite vocabulary is one of the hallmarks of the character. Examples of unfamiliar words â€” or unfamiliar uses of words that some would otherwise consider familiar â€” are found throughout the corpus, often in the give-and-take between Wolfe and Archie.
Ortho-cousin , chapter 1. Wolfe to Archie:
More transparent was the reason for Mr. Frost's familiarity with so strange a term as 'ortho-cousin,' strictly a word for an anthropologist, though it leaves room for various speculations. ... Ortho-cousins are those whose parents are of the same sex â€” the children of two brothers or of two sisters; whereas cross-cousins are those whose parents are brother and sister. In some tribes cross-cousins may marry, but not ortho-cousins. Obviously Mr. Frost has investigated the question thoroughly.
Spiff , chapter 3. Archie:
He [Llewllyn Frost] stopped, smiling from Wolfe to me and back again like a haberdasher's clerk trying to sell an old number with a big spiff on it.
Yclept, chapter 8. Archie:
Boyden McNair, with his right elbow on his knee and his bent head resting on the hand which covered his eyes, sat near Wolfe's desk in the dunce's chair, yclept that by me on the day that District Attorney Anderson of Westchester sat in it while Wolfe made a dunce of him.
Reviews and commentary
Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime â€” Stout rarely has Nero Wolfe lured away from home on a case, but in this one Archie does it with orchids. Poisoning at a fashion show is the crime that Wolfe's method of exhaustive interrogation mixed with bluff is involved to solve. Archie is thinner and less amusing here than elsewhere, but we learn more about Wolfe from himself. [2]
Clifton Fadiman , The New Yorker â€” Nero Wolfe leaves his orchids for the first time to solve the case of the poisoned fashion model. This one has practically everything the seasoned addict demands in the way of characters and action; you may guess the motive, but the mechanism is properly obscure. [3]
Edmund Wilson wrote that the novel was "somewhat padded ... full of long episodes that led nowhere," and left him with the feeling that he "had to unpack large crates by swallowing the excelsior in order to find at the bottom a few bent and rusty nails."
The New Yorker
The Red Box was the subject of a squib in the September 28, 1946, issue of The New Yorker magazine:
The 1946 Avon paperback reissue of The Red Box drew the attention of The New Yorker , which listed 17 instances of Wolfe's finger-wiggling (September 28, 1946)
