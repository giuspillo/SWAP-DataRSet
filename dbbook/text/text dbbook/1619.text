The proposal also calls for an advance monthly tax rebate to households of citizens and legal resident aliens, to "untax" purchases up to the poverty level. The bill was reintroduced in January 2007 as the Fair Tax Act of 2007. The sequel to The FairTax Book, FairTax: The Truth: Answering the Critics, was released by HarperCollins on February 12, 2008.
