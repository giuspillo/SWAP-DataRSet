After recriminating Astolfo for wearing another woman's portrait around his neck, Estrella commands Rosaura (still going by Astrea) to fetch this locket for her. When she approaches Astolfo for the locket, he says he recognized her as Rosaura and refuses to give her the locket, because the portrait inside is hers. Estrella walks in and demands to see it immediately, but, afraid of being discovered, Rosaura says the locket in Astolfo's hand is actually her own, and that he has hidden the one she was sent to fetch. Estrella leaves furious. Meanwhile, Clotaldo sends Clarin to prison, believing that Clarin knows his secret.
Segismundo mutters in his sleep about murder and revenge. When the prince wakes up, he tells Clotaldo about his "dream". Clotaldo tells him that even in dreams, people must act with kindness and justice. When he leaves, Segismundo is left reflecting on dreams and life.
Act III
The people find out that they have a prince and many rebel, breaking him out of his prison tower, although at first they comically mistake Clarin for the prince. Segismundo finds Clotaldo, who is afraid of his reaction. Segismundo forgives him, asking to join his cause, but Clotaldo refuses, swearing allegiance to the king. Back in the palace, everyone prepares for battle, and Clotaldo reveals to Rosaura that he is her father. She asks him to take Astolfo's life, as he had taken her honor before leaving her. Clotaldo refuses, reminding her that Duke Astolfo is now the heir to the throne. When Rosaura asks what will be of her honor, Clotaldo suggests that she spend her days in a nunnery. Disheartened, Rosaura runs away.
As war nears, Segismundo sees Rosaura, who tells him that she was the youth who found him in his prison and also the woman who he tried to seduce in court. She tells him that she was born in Muscovy of a noble woman who was disgraced and abandoned. She had the same fate, falling in love with Astolfo and giving him her honor before he abandoned her to marry Estrella. She followed him to Poland for revenge, finding that Clotaldo is her father, but he is unwilling to fight for her honor. Rosaura compares herself to female warriors Athena and Diana. She wants to join Segismundo's battle and to kill Astolfo or to die fighting. Segismundo agrees. While soldiers cheer for Segismundo, Rosaura and Clarin are reunited, and the king's soldiers approach.
Segismundo's army is winning the battle. Basilio, Clotaldo, and Astolfo are preparing to escape when Clarin is killed in front of them. Segismundo arrives and Basilio faces his son, waiting for his death, but Segismundo spares his life. In light of the Prince's generous attitude, the King proclaims Segismundo heir to his throne. As King, Segismundo decides that Astolfo must keep his promise to marry Rosaura to preserve her honor. At first Astolfo is hesitant because she is not of noble birth, but when Clotaldo reveals that she is his daughter, Astolfo consents. Segismundo then claims Estrella in marriage himself. Segismundo resolves to live by the motto that "God is God", acknowledging that, whether asleep or awake, one must strive for goodness.
Themes and motifs
CalderÃ³n
Dreams vs. reality
The concept of life as a dream is an ancient one found in Hinduism and Platonism. It has been explored by writers from Lope de Vega to Shakespeare. [17] Key elements from the play may be derived from the Christian legend of Barlaam and Josaphat , which Lope de Vega had brought to the stage. [18] This legend is, itself, a derivation of the story of the early years of Siddharta Gautama , which serves as the basis for the film Little Buddha that illustrates the Hindu-Buddhist concept of reality as illusion . [18]
Fate vs. free will
The idea of a Prince who is prophesized at birth to be doomed to cause a disaster, and his father the King attempting to avert that disaster, is similar to that of Oedipus killing his father.[ citation needed ] De Vega's play Lo que ha de ser (1624) also includes the incarceration of a child and the importance of astrology.[ citation needed ]
The concept of free will versus predestination is also widely discussed in religion. Catholic Spain's Counter-reformation defined human will as able to choose the good (in cooperation with God's grace ), while the Calvinist conception talked about the total depravity of the human will unless predestined by God to be renewed by grace.[ citation needed ] In Calderon's work, however, Catholicism is melded with "pagan" astrology , as Segismundo's horoscope , as interpreted by Basilio, becomes the cause of his incarceration. In the end, and favoring the Spanish, Catholic faith, Segismundo chooses pardon against the oracle.[ citation needed ]
Father vs. son conflict
One of the major conflicts of the play is the opposition between king and prince, which parallels with the struggle of Uranus vs. Saturn or Saturn vs. Jupiter in classical mythology. [19] This struggle is a typical representation of the opposition in baroque comedy between the values represented by a fatherly figure and those embodied by the son. [18] An opposition which, in this case, may have biographical elements. [20]
Other motifs and themes
Motifs and themes derived from a number of traditions found in this drama include the labyrinth , the monster, the four elements, original sin, pride and disillusionment. [21] [22] [23] [24]
Analysis and Interpretations
Rosaura subplot
Burgtheater - Sigismund und Rosaura - Calderon de la Barca
The Rosaura subplot has been subjected to much criticism in the past as not belonging to the work. MenÃ©ndez y Pelayo saw it as a strange and exotic plot, like a parasitical vine. [25] Rosaura has also been dismissed as the simple stock character of the jilted woman. With the British School of Calderonistas, this attitude changed. A. E. Sloman explained how the main and secondary actions are linked. [26] Others like E. M. Wilson and William M. Whitby consider Rosaura to be central to the work since she parallels Segismundo's actions and also serves as Segismundo's guide, leading him to a final conversion. [27] [28] For some Rosaura must be studied as part of a Platonic ascent on the part of the Prince. Others compare her first appearance, falling from a horse/hippogriff to the plot of Ariosto 's Orlando furioso where Astolfo (the name of the character who deceives Rosaura in our play), also rides the hippogriff and witnesses a prophecy of the return of the mythical Golden Age. For Frederick de Armas , Rosaura hides a mythological mystery already utilized by Ariosto. When she goes to Court, she takes on the name of Astraea , the goddess of chastity and justice. Astraea was the last of the immortals to leave earth with the decline of the ages. Her return signals the return of a Golden Age. Many writers of the Renaissance and early modern periods used the figure of Astraea to praise the rulers of their times. It is possible that Rosaura (an anagram of auroras, "dawns") could represent the return of a Golden Age during the reign of Segismundo, a figure that represents King Philip IV of Spain . [29]
Segismundo's soliloquy
La vida es sueÃ±o, 35th Festival
Life Is a Dream is one of CalderÃ³n's most well-known and well-studied works. This interest not only hails from the play's complex philosophy, but also from its notable dramatic structure. However, ever since Marcelino MenÃ©ndez y Pelayo 's 1910 classification of Life Is a Dream as a philosophical drama, criticism has largely dwelled on the existential issues of the work, often at the cost of paying specific attention to its formal dramatic characteristics.[ citation needed ]
A few central ideas constitute the major philosophical themes of the play: the opposition between destiny and liberty, the topic of life as a dream, and the theme of free will. These central themes overshadow other themes present, like the education of princes, the model ruler, power, and justice.
Focusing on Segismundo's line, "Y los sueÃ±os, sueÃ±os son", a more accurate English translation, better representing CalderÃ³n's poetic and philosophical intent, may be given as: "And dreams themselves are merely the dreams of dreams", implying and underscoring the ephemeral nature of human life and physical existence.
Segismundo's conclusions
There have been many different interpretations of the playâ€™s ending, where Segismundo condemns the rebel soldier who freed him to life imprisonment in the tower. Some have suggested that this scene is ironic â€“ that it raises questions about whether Segismundo will in fact be a just king. Others have pointed out that CalderÃ³n, who lived under the Spanish monarchy, could not have left the rebel soldier unpunished, because this would be an affront to royal authority.
It is worth considering that Segismundoâ€™s transformation in the course of the play is not simply a moral awakening, but a realization of his social role as the heir to the throne, and this role requires him to act as kings act. For some, the act of punishing the rebel soldier makes him a Machiavellian prince. [30] Others argue that, while this action may seem unjust, it is in keeping with his new social status as the king. Daniel L. Heiple traces a long tradition of works where treason seems to be rewarded, but the traitor or rebel is subsequently punished. [31]
It may well be that, rather than intending his audience to see this action as purely right or wrong, CalderÃ³n purposefully made it ambiguous, creating an interesting tension in the play that adds to its depth.
