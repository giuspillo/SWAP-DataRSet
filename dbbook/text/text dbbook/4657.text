Plot summary
A. J. Bayes illustration, 1889
On a cold New Year's Eve , a poor girl tries to sell matches in the street. She is already shivering from cold and early hypothermia . [1] Still she is afraid to go home because her father will beat her for not selling any matches. She shelters in a nook and sits down, sitting down accelerates hypothermia. [2]
The girl lights the matches to warm herself, in their glow, she sees several lovely visions including a Christmas tree and a holiday feast. All four visions can be seen as hallucinations due to hypothermia but Andersen meant the last vision at least to be real. [3] [4] The girl looks skyward and sees a shooting star , then she remembers her dead grandmother saying that such a falling star means someone is dying and is going to Heaven , this is an old folklore belief. [5] As she lights the next match, she sees a vision of her grandmother, the only person to have treated her with love and kindness. Many near-death experiences include visions or hallucinations of people now dead. [6] She strikes one match after another to keep the vision of her grandmother alive for as long as she can.
Running out of matches, the child dies and her grandmother carries her soul to Heaven. The next morning, passers-by find the child dead in the nook and take pity on her. They do not know about her visions. Andersen saw this as a happy ending because in Heaven the girl would no longer be hungry, cold or abused. [7]
Sources
The source for the story was a widely popular woodcut illustration by the Danish artist Johan Thomas Lundbye depicting a poor child selling matches printed in a calendar for 1843; several illustrations had been sent to Andersen by the editor of an almanac requesting him to write a story around one. [8]
Another known inspiration for the story is the well-known fairy tale The Star Money previously recorded by the Brothers Grimm .[ citation needed ] It is a story of an impoverished young girl who gives away everything that she has to the needy and ends up with nothing but her love for God. Her selflessness is later rewarded by stars falling from the sky towards the earth, proven to be silver coins. The Grimms' variation differs, ending with the girl remaining alive and receiving divine gifts (money that falls from the stars) for her charity.
