Parade's End is a tetralogy (four related novels) by Ford Madox Ford published between 1924 and 1928. It is set mainly in England and on the Western Front in World War I, where Ford served as an officer in the Welsh Regiment, a life vividly depicted in the novels. In December 2010, John N. Gray hailed it as "possibly the greatest 20th-century novel in English". Likewise, Mary Gordon labeled it as "quite simply, the best fictional treatment of war in the history of the novel". In 2012, HBO, BBC, and VRT produced a television adaptation written by Tom Stoppard and starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Rebecca Hall.
History
Ford stated that his purpose in creating this work was "the obviating of all future wars". [3] The four novels were originally published under the titles: Some Do Not ... (1924), No More Parades (1925), A Man Could Stand Up â€” (1926), and Last Post (or The Last Post in the USA) (1928). They were combined into one volume as Parade's End, which has been ranked at number 57 on the Modern Library 's 100 Best Novels list. [4]
Plot
The novels chronicle the life of Christopher Tietjens, "the last Tory ", a brilliant government statistician from a wealthy landowning family who is serving in the British Army during World War I . His wife Sylvia is a flippant socialite who seems intent on ruining him. Tietjens may or may not be the father of his wife's child. Meanwhile, his incipient affair with Valentine Wannop, a high-spirited pacifist and suffragette , has not been consummated, despite what all their friends believe. The two central novels follow Tietjens in the army in France and Belgium, as well as Sylvia and Valentine in their separate paths over the course of the war.
Literary notes
Notably among war novels , Tietjens' consciousness takes primacy over the war-events it filters. Ford constructs a protagonist for whom the war is but one layer of his life, and not always even the most prominent though he is in the middle of it. In a narrative beginning before the war and ending after the armistice, Ford's project is to situate an unimaginable cataclysm within a social, moral and psychological complexity.
The work is also striking in its investigation of the relationship between gender dynamics, war, and societal upheaval. Scholar David Ayers notes that "Parade's End is virtually alone of the male writing of the 1920s in affirming the ascendance of women and advocating a course of graceful withdrawal from dominance for men". [6]
Textual history
The four novels were reissued separately by Penguin just after the Second World War (in 1948). They were first combined into one volume under the collective title Parade's End (which had been suggested by Ford, though he didn't live to see an omnibus version) in the Knopf edition of 1950, which has been the basis of several subsequent reissues. Graham Greene controversially omitted Last Post from his Bodley Head edition of Ford's writing, calling [7] it "an afterthought which he (Ford) had not intended to write and later regretted having written." Greene went on to state that "...the Last Post was more than a mistakeâ€”it was a disaster, a disaster which has delayed a full critical appreciation of Parade's End." Certainly Last Post is very different from the other three novels. It is concerned with peace and reconstruction, and Christopher Tietjens is absent for most of the narrative, which is structured as a series of interior monologues by those closest to him. Yet it has had influential admirers, from Dorothy Parker and Carl Clinton Van Doren to Anthony Burgess and Malcolm Bradbury (who also included it in his 1992 Everyman edition). The first annotated and critical edition of the novels, edited by Max Saunders, Joseph Wiesenfarth, Sara Haslam, and Paul Skinner, was published by Carcanet Press in 2010â€“11. [8]
