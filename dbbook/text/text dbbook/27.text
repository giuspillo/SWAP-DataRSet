A Cellarful of Noise is the title of Brian Epstein's 1964 autobiography. His assistant, Derek Taylor, was the ghostwriter of the book, which describes the early days of The Beatles, whom Epstein managed. Epstein asked John Lennon what he thought the book should be called, and Lennon suggested "Queer Jew". Lennon was later quoted as saying that the book should have been titled, "A Cellarful of Boys" in reference to Epstein's homosexuality. In the 1978 film, All You Need is Cash, Leggy Mountbatten's book—the manager of the Rutles and a parody of Epstein—is titled A Cellarful of Goys, a reference to Epstein being Jewish—"goys" sounding similar to "noise"). The phrase is also in the lyrics of Petula Clark's 1965 hit "I Know a Place."
