Death of a Doxy is a Nero Wolfe detective novel by Rex Stout, first published by Viking Press in 1966.
Nero Wolfe â€” The private investigator
Archie Goodwin â€” Wolfe's assistant (and the narrator of all Wolfe stories)
Orrie Cather â€” An operative frequently in Wolfe's employ, along with Saul Panzer and Fred Durkin. Orrie's activities in this book are very limited, but the plot centers on his dalliance with Isabel Kerr.
Jill Hardy â€” An airline attendant, then termed "stewardess," and Orrie's fiancee
Isabel Kerr â€” The murder victim, occupant of a plush apartment, of whom a newspaper wrote, "It does not appear that Miss Kerr was employed anywhere or engaged in any regular activity."
Stella Fleming â€” Isabel's sister, whose greatest fear is that Isabel's lifestyle will be publicized
Barry Fleming â€” Stella's husband, a mathematics professor
Avery Ballou â€” A CEO, a devotee of the works of Rudyard Kipling, and the source of Ms. Kerr's rent and other living expenses
Julie Jaquette (stage name of Amy Jackson) â€” A successful nightclub singer and Isabel Kerr's best friend
Inspector Cramer â€” Representing Manhattan Homicide
Reviews and commentary
Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime â€” First-rate Stout done at the age of 80. The tightness of the plot, the wit, and the people are done with sureness and speed, so that the book, though short, gives one the sense of having lived through a long stretch of tense expectation. New roles, too, for Orrie Cather, Cramer, and Wolfe in relation to a murder which they are not asked to investigate. Wolfe gets his $50,000 fee, which one hopes he splits with the author. [3]
Terry Teachout , About Last Night, "Forty years with Nero Wolfe" (January 12, 2009) â€” Rex Stout's witty, fast-moving prose hasn't dated a day, while Wolfe himself is one of the enduringly great eccentrics of popular fiction. I've spent the past four decades reading and re-reading Stout's novels for pleasure, and they have yet to lose their savor ... It is to revel in such writing that I return time and again to Stout's books, and in particular to The League of Frightened Men , Some Buried Caesar , The Silent Speaker , Too Many Women , Murder by the Book , Before Midnight , Plot It Yourself , Too Many Clients , The Doorbell Rang , and Death of a Doxy, which are for me the best of all the full-length Wolfe novels.

The Netherlands release has optional Dutch subtitles and, like the A&E DVD release, presents the episode in 4:3 pan and scan rather than its 16:9 aspect ratio for widescreen viewing. [6]

Publication history
1966, New York: The Viking Press , August 19, 1966, hardcover [7]
In his limited-edition pamphlet, Collecting Mystery Fiction #10, Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe Part II, Otto Penzler describes the first edition of Death of a Doxy: "Yellow boards, gray cloth spine; front cover printed with a blue design; spine printed with blue lettering; rear cover blank. Issued in a red, black, and white dust photographic wrapper which has been die cut to reveal the blue printed design on the front cover. â€¦ The dust wrapper is noteworthy for its ugliness and the singularly misconceived design element of the pointess die cut." [8]
In April 2006, Firsts: The Book Collector's Magazine estimated that the first edition of Death of a Doxy had a value of between $100 and $200. The estimate is for a copy in very good to fine condition in a like dustjacket. [9]
1966, New York: Viking ( Mystery Guild ), October 1966, hardcover
The far less valuable Viking book club edition may be distinguished from the first edition in three ways:
The dust jacket has "Book Club Edition" printed on the inside front flap, and the price is absent (first editions may be price clipped if they were given as gifts).
Book club editions are sometimes thinner and always taller (usually a quarter of an inch) than first editions.
Book club editions are bound in cardboard, and first editions are bound in cloth (or have at least a cloth spine). [10]
