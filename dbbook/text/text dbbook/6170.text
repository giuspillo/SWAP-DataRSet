Though Darkover Landfall is not the first book written in the series, in the Darkover timeline its events are the beginning for all that follows.
Of this book, J. John Jones, writing for Amazing Stories, notes, "Landfall has been a disappointment for some women. Iâ€™ve read reviews by some feminist critics who have vilified the work, expecting something more radical, apparently, from a woman writer. I still find her ideas provocative. No doubt some women are offended by the roles of planned breeding that her women characters portrayed. Still, stimulating rage is one way to effect social change so you might suppose that her works still gave some impetus for social change even with the roles that her women characters portray in this imagined society."
