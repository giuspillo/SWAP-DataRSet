Plot summary
The novel opens with Hap Collins working as a security guard at a chicken plant. One night he saves the owner's daughter from a violent rapist, and the owner rewards him with ten thousand dollars. Hap and Leonard take a cruise, but they get into a dispute with a maitre de about the ship and find themselves marooned in Mexico. While there they are mugged, and rescued by a fisherman named Ferdinand and his daughter Beatrice. Hap forms a sexual relationship with Beatrice while the two stay with them, and discovers that she owes a large amount of money to a local gangster named Juan Miguel. Just before they leave to go back to Mexico, Beatrice is violently murdered, presumably by Juan Miguel's thugs.
Once back in Texas, Hap and Leonard attempt to move past the events of the last few days, but when their friend Charlie is killed they realise that Juan Miguel is attempting to silence them. Along with their associate, a detective named Jim Bob, and Hap's occasional girlfriend Brett, they return to Mexico to finish matters. They first attempt to stage a kidnapping of one of Juan Miguel's mistresses, but this attempt goes awry and some of Jim Bob's friends are killed. Deciding that matters must be settled in the most direct and uncomplicated manner possible, Hap breaks into Juan Miguel's compound, hides in his backyard and executes him, along with one of his employees. At the novel's conclusion Hap has a new job, once more as a security guard, and he and Brett have moved in together.
