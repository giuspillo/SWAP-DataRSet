Historical basis
This novel is based on the true story of Juana Maria , better known to history as "The Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island," a NicoleÃ±o Indian left alone for 18 years on San Nicolas Island , one of the Channel Islands off the California coast, before being discovered in 1853. It was believed that she lived in a cave on the island; in 2012, a Naval archeologist believes he has found that cave and investigation is ongoing. [2]
Plot summary
The main character is a girl named Karana, which is her secret name. Her people live in a village called Ghalas-at, gathering roots and fishing to supply the tribe. One day, a ship of Aleuts , led by a Russian named Captain Orlov, arrives and persuades the natives to let them hunt sea otter in return for other goods. However, the Aleuts attempt to swindle the islanders and leave without paying. When they are confronted by Chief Chowig, Karana's father, a battle breaks out, and lives are lost on both sides. The tribe is greatly reduced, and the Aleuts leave the island, leaving little payment for the otters they hunted. Karana's father and many other men in the tribe die during the battle.
Later, the "replacement chief", Chief Kimki, leaves the island on a canoe for new land in the East. Eventually, he sends a "giant canoe" to bring his people to the mainland, even though he himself does not return. The white men come to Karana's village and tell them to pack their goods and go to the ship. Karana's brother, Ramo, leaves the ship to retrieve his fishing spear. Although Karana urges the captain to wait for Ramo to return, the ship must leave before a storm approaches. Karana jumps off the ship and swims to shore, and the ship departs without them.
The siblings live alone on the island, hoping the ship will return. Ramo is brutally killed by a pack of feral dogs (according to Karana, he had a gaping wound on his throat and teeth marks on his body). Alone on the island, Karana takes on traditionally male tasks, such as hunting, making spears , and building canoes , to survive. She vows to avenge her brother's death and kills several of the dogs, but has a change of heart when she encounters the leader of the pack. She tames him and names him Rontu, meaning "Fox eyes" in her language.
Over time, Karana makes a life for herself. She builds a home made of whale bones and stocks a cave with provisions in case the Aleuts come back, so she can hide from them. As she explores her island, Karana discovers ancient artifacts and a large squid (which she calls a devilfish). As time passes, she decides to hunt the devilfish. She also tames some birds and an otter; she feels a close kinship to the animals, the only inhabitants of the island beside herself.
One summer, the Aleuts return, and Karana takes refuge in the cave. She observes the Aleuts closely and realized that a girl named Tutok takes care of the domestic duties, including getting water from the pool near Karana's cave. Despite Karana's precautions, she and the young Aleut woman meet and befriend each other. They exchange presents when possible. Karana realizes how lonely she has been without other people. Later the Aleuts leave with Tutok; the men are none the wiser of Karana's presence, but their departure also deprives her of her newfound friend.
More time passes, and Rontu dies. Karana soon finds a young dog that looks like Rontu and takes him in, naming him Rontu-Aru ("Son of Rontu"). One day, Karana sees the sails of a ship. It docks at the shore, but it then leaves. Two years later, in the spring, the boat comes back, so Karana dresses in her finest attire and goes to the shore to meet the boat. Her rescuers see that her attire is not appropriate for the mainland, and they have a dress made for her. Although she does not like the dress, Karana realizes that it is part of her new life. The ship takes Karana and Rontu-Aru to the mission in Santa Barbara , California .
