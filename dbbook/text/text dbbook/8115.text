The Red and the Green is a 1965 novel by Iris Murdoch that covers the events leading up to and during the Easter Rebellion in Ireland during World War I. It is written in a different style than Murdoch's other fiction, but like the other novels deals with complex family relationships, which has some relationship to the author's own family. It is interesting for Murdoch's use of existentialism in the actions of its main protagonist Andrew Chase-White, an Anglo-Irishman who has volunteered and become a young officer in the King Edward's Horse regiment, leading to a conflict with the other, Catholic side of his family. {{#invoke: Navbox | navbox }}
