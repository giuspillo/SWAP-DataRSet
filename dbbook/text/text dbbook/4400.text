According to the biography in the book, this was Ray Bradbury's first novel since the publication of Something Wicked This Way Comes (not counting the young adult novel The Halloween Tree ). It evokes both the milieu and style of other mystery writers Raymond Chandler , Dashiell Hammett , James M. Cain , and Ross Macdonald , all of whom Bradbury names in the book's dedication , and James Crumley , after whom Bradbury named his detective. Yet the main character is undoubtedly Bradbury himself, portrayed in a period of his life just before his marriage and his success with The Martian Chronicles .
