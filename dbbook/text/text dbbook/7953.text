Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire is a book by Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt, published in 2004. It is a sequel to the 2000 book, Empire.
Summary
The rapid growth of the alter-globalisation movement , evident in the large protests in Seattle in 1999 and in Genova in 2001, along with the creation of the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre , also in 2001, seemed to substantiate the optimistic outlook at the end of Empire. The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 and subsequent rise of state-sponsored " counter-terrorism " seem, however, to have complicated this optimism.
Multitude addresses these issues and elaborates on the assertion, in the Preface to Empire, that:
"The creative forces of the multitude that sustain Empire are also capable of autonomously constructing a counter-Empire, an alternative political organization of global flows and exchanges." [1]
Multitude is divided into three sections: "War," which addresses the current "global civil war" [2] ; "Multitude," which elucidates the "multitude" as an "active social subject, which acts on the basis of what the singularities share in common" [2] ; and, "Democracy," which critiques traditional forms of political representation and gestures toward alternatives.
