The Sunlight Dialogues is a 1972 novel by the American author ]]John Gardner.
Plot summary
The novel is set in the 1960s in Batavia, New York . It follows Batavia police chief Fred Clumly in his pursuit of a magician known as the Sunlight Man , a champion of existential freedom and pre-biblical Babylonian philosophy. As Clumly believes in absolute law, order, justice and a Judeo-Christian world view, the two butt their ideological heads in a number of dialogues, all recorded on audiocassette by Clumly. Each of these two characters attempts to exert power over the otherâ€”Clumly with the law behind him and the Sunlight Man with his magic and violenceâ€”until they wear down not only each other, but many of the other characters with whom they come into contact. A myriad of side-stories provides background for the plot.
