The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. , commonly referred to as The Sketch Book, is a collection of 34 essays and short stories written by American author Washington Irving. It was published serially throughout 1819 and 1820. The collection includes two of Irving's best-known stories, attributed to the fictional Dutch historian Diedrich Knickerbocker, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" and "Rip Van Winkle. " It also marks Irving's first use of the pseudonym "Geoffrey Crayon," which he would continue to employ throughout his literary career. The Sketch Book, along with James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, was the first widely read work of American literature in Britain and Europe. It also helped advance the reputation of American writers with an international audience.
English edition
Portions of The Sketch Book were almost immediately reprinted in British literary magazines â€” and with no real international copyright laws to protect American works from being reprinted in England, poached American writers were entitled neither to the profits for their work, nor to legal recourse. Irving was concerned about such literary piracy â€” "I am fearful some [British] Bookseller in the American trade may get hold of [The Sketch Book]," he told his brother in law, "and so run out an edition of it without my adapting it for the London public â€” or participating in the profits." [10] Determined to protect The Sketch Book from further poaching, Irving arranged to secure his British copyright by self-publishing the work in London.
An early admirer of Irving and his work, Sir Walter Scott encouraged his own publisher, John Murray, to take up The Sketch Book.
The first four American installments were collected into a single volume and self-published by Irving in London, under John Millerâ€™s Burlington Arcade imprint, on February 16, 1820. [11] In early April, however, Miller went bankrupt, leaving the bulk of The Sketch Book unsold in his warehouse. [12]
Searching for another publisher, Irving appealed to his friend and mentor, Sir Walter Scott , for assistance. Scott approached his own publisher, London powerhouse John Murray , and convinced him to purchase the rest of the stock and continue publication. (In gratitude, Irving dedicated the English editions of The Sketch Book to Walter Scott.) Heartened by the enthusiastic response to The Sketch Book, Murray encouraged Irving to publish the remaining three American installments as a second volume as quickly as possible. [13]
In July 1820, Murray published the second volume of The Sketch Book, including all the pieces from the final three American installments, plus three additional essays: the American Indian sketches "Philip of Pokanoket" and "Traits of Indian Character," which Irving had originally written for the Analectic Magazine in 1814, and a short original piece, "Lâ€™Envoy," in which Irving thanked his British readers for their indulgence.
Given the speed with which Murray put the second volume to press, the essays included in the final installment of the American edition were actually published in London first, several months before they made their appearance in the United States.
Given Irving's additions, the English version of The Sketch Book contained thirty-two pieces, while its American counterpart contained only twenty-nine.
Author's revised edition
In 1848, as part of the Author's Revised Edition he was completing for publisher George Putnam , Irving added two new stories to The Sketch Book â€” "London Antiques" and "A Sunday in London" â€” as well as a new preface and the postscript to "Rip Van Winkle." [14] Irving also slightly changed the order of the sketches, placing a number of essays from the seventh American installment earlier in the collection, and moving "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" into a place of prominence as the final story in the collection ("L'Envoy" being merely a thank you to readers).
Public and critical response
The first American reviews were the result of well-placed advance publicity, performed on Irvingâ€™s behalf by his friend Henry Brevoort. Three days after the bookâ€™s release, Brevoort placed an anonymous review in the New-York Evening Post, lauding The Sketch Book and making it clear to readers that it was Irvingâ€™s work:
The graces of style; the rich, warm tone of benevolent feeling; the freely-flowing vein of hearty and happy humour, and the fine-eyed spirit of observation, sustained by an enlightened understanding and regulated by a perception of fitness â€” a tact â€” wonderfully quick and sure, for which Mr. Irving has been heretofore so much distinguished, are all exhibited anew in the Sketch Book, with freshened beauty and added charms. [15]
Outside Irvingâ€™s immediate circle of friends, however, the reviews were equally as positive. As critic Gulian Verplanck wrote:
It will be needless to inform any who have read the book, that it is from the pen of Mr. Irving. His rich, and sometimes extravagant humour, his gay and graceful fancy . . . betray the author in every page; even without the aid of those minor peculiarities of style, taste, and local allusions, which at once identify the travelled Geoffrey Crayon with the venerable Knickerbocker. [16]
Two of the book's early admirers were Sir Walter Scott (who called it "positively beautiful") [17] and Lord Byron (who said of the book, "I know it by heart"). [18] Years later, poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said The Sketch Book was one of the earliest works to excite his interest in literature. As he said, "Every reader has his first book; I mean to say, one book among all others which in early youth first fascinates his imagination, and at once excites and satisfies the desires of his mind... To me, this first book was The Sketch Book of Washington Irving". [19]
Apart from "Rip Van Winkle" and "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," both of which were immediately acknowledged as The Sketch Bookâ€™s finest pieces, American and English readers alike responded most strongly to the more sentimental tales, especially "The Broken Heart," â€” which Byron claimed had made him weep [20] â€” and "The Widow and Her Son."
In Britain, the book did much to promote Americans as legitimate writers, and their work as legitimate literature â€” a concept that surprised English critics. "Everywhere I find in it the marks of a mind of the utmost elegance and refinement," wrote the English historian William Godwin , "a thing as you know that I was not exactly prepared to look for in an American." [21] The English magazine Quarterly Review agreed. "[Irving] seems to have studied our language where alone it can be studied in all its strength and perfection, and in working these precious mines of literature he has refined for himself the ore which there so richly abounds." [22]
Even Irving admitted that he was pleased to have stunned the skeptical English critics. When one English admirer asked Irving to confirm that he was really an American, Irving responded enthusiastically: "The doubts which her ladyship has heard on the subject seem to have arisen from the old notion that it is impossible for an American to write decent English." [23]
The book is compared favourably with William Pinnock 's English educational texts in George Eliot 's novel The Mill on the Floss (1860): Maggie, talking about her 'gloomy fancy' to her cousin Lucy says:
"Perhaps it comes from the school diet - watery rice-pudding spiced with Pinnock . Let us hope it will give way before my mother's custards and this charming Geoffrey Crayon." Maggie took up the Sketch Book, which lay by her on the table. (Book 6, Chapter 2)
The Sketch Book cemented Irvingâ€™s reputation, and propelled him to a level of celebrity previously unseen for an American writer. "I am astonished at the success of my writings in England," Irving wrote to his publisher, "and can hardly persuade myself that it is not all a dream. Had any one told me a few years since in America, that any thing I could write would interest such men as . . . Byron, I should have as readily believed a fairy tale." [24]
Influence on American culture
The Sketch Book introduced three of Irving's most enduring and iconic characters, Rip Van Winkle , Ichabod Crane , and the Headless Horseman .
One of the most significant influences of The Sketch Book came from its cycle of five Christmas stories, portraying an idealized and old-fashioned Yule celebration at an English country manor. Irving's stories depicted harmonious warm-hearted English Christmas customs he observed while staying in Aston Hall , Birmingham, England, that had largely been abandoned, [25] and he used the tract Vindication of Christmas (London 1652) of Old English Christmas traditions, that he had transcribed into his journal as a format for his stories. [26] Except Pennsylvania German Settlers, who were enthusiastic celebrators of Christmas, Irving contributed to a revival of customs in America. Charles Dickens later credited Irving as an influence on his own Christmas writings, including the classic A Christmas Carol .
