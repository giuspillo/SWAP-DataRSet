Plot Summary
Esperanza Ortega was a wealthy girl who had everything she wanted and had a loving mother and father. Now She is Poor. One day, her father and some of his men are mysteriously killed by bandits while he is tending to their ranch. Her father intended to leave everything to his wife, Ramona, and Esperanza, but the family lawyer informs them that a loophole in the will states that the ranch, where most of the money comes from, will go to SeÃ±or Ortega's shitty brother, Luis Ortega, whom Esperanza calls TÃ­o Luis, [2] who is implied to have a hand at SeÃ±or Ortega's murder. He plans to go into politics even deeper, and feels that with Ramona, a famous wealthy socialite loved by many in their town, will look good on his side and offers to marry her, giving her a month to grieve her husband. She refuses, and he subtly threatens that bad things will happen if she does not marry him.
Their mansion later burns during a mysterious fire and TÃ­o Luis returns and re-offers his wedding proposal. Ramona accepts, under the condition that he rebuilds the mansion and send her money and a wagon to visit her mother, Abuelita. [3] Esperanza openly tells him she dislikes him, and he says the moment he becomes her stepfather, he will send her to a boarding school. Later on, Ramona tells Esperanza that she is not planning to marry him, and plans to escape to America. With the help of Abuelita, Esperanza's grandmother, they trick TÃ­o Luis to give Ramona money and necessities, and escape with the help of their loyal servants across the border, leaving Abuelita behind and promising to come back for her.
Ramona and Esperanza live in a poor Mexican labor camp in Arvin, California [4] with their servants and their families. Ramona adjusts to a poor life, but Esperanza's attempt to hold on to her memories are laughed upon by the poor children, especially a poor girl named Marta. Despite what happened, Esperanza and her family must migrate to the United States. Unfortunately, they move during the Great Depression. Now Esperanza learns to face conflicts and "rise" above them.
Background
American migrants from Oklahoma (called Okies ) were often hostile toward Mexicans because they felt they were taking away their jobs. Mexican migrant laborers would work for much lower pay, so employers would much rather hire them. There was also much tension between the migrant workers on the fields. Some felt that their conditions were unlivable, and they deserved much better, so they began to protest and fight for what they believed. Still, others refused to join the protest in fear that they would be fired. In the 1920s and 1930s (about the time story takes place) California remained about 88% white. Most of these people were those who owned the land, while the 36,800 workers, many of whom were Mexicans, did not.
Critical reception
Along with its Best Books citation, Publishers Weekly gave Esperanza Rising a starred review, citing its "lyrical, fairy tale - like style". It praised the way "Ryan poetically conveys Esperanza's ties to the land by crafting her story to the rhythms of the seasons" and the fact that "Ryan fluidly juxtaposes world events... with one family's will to survive". [5] Kirkus Reviews disliked the "epic tone, characters that develop little and predictably, and... romantic patina". However it also found that the "style is engaging, her characters appealing", ultimately saying that the story "bears telling to a wider audience". [6]
Children's Literature praised Esperanza Rising and suggested that it "would be a great choice for a multicultural collection". [7] The book has been incorporated into school curriculum in literature, social studies, and Spanish. [8] The University of Missouri has a detailed literature unit available online, including maps, photos and links to other resources. [9] Berkely High School used recordings of the book with its English as a Second Language students in an Earphone English group. They found that Esperanza Rising doesn't just appeal to students who, like Esperanza, have emigrated from Mexico, but "also to those who have moved here after losing their fathers to violence in the former Yugoslavia".
