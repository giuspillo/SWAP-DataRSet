Lest Darkness Fall is an alternate history science fiction novel written in 1939 by author L. Sprague de Camp. The book is often considered one of the best examples of the alternate history genre; it is certainly one of the most influential. Alternate history author Harry Turtledove has said it sparked his interest in the genre as well as his desire to study Byzantine history.

Plot summary
Lest Darkness Fall is similar to Mark Twain 's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court . American archaeologist Martin Padway is visiting the Pantheon in Rome in 1938. A thunderstorm arrives, lightning cracks, and he finds himself transported to 6th century Rome (535).
The obscure period Padway arrives in is while Italy is ruled by the Ostrogoths , a tribe which recently overthrew the Western Roman Empire , but (in de Camp's opinion anyway) ruled with benevolence, allowing freedom of religion, and maintaining the urban Roman society they had conquered.
In reality the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire temporarily expanded westwards, embarking on what came to be known as the Gothic War (535â€“554) . They overthrew the Ostrogoths and the Vandals in north Africa , but they never consolidated their rule over Italy, and it collapsed into smaller states with further invasions by the Lombards . The war devastated the Italian urbanized society that was supported by a settled hinterland, and by the end of the conflict Italy was considerably depopulated: its population is estimated to have decreased from 7 million to 2.5 million people. The great cities of Rome were abandoned as Italy fell into a long period of decline. Some historians consider this the true beginning of the Dark Ages .
Padway initially wonders if he is dreaming or delusional, but he quickly accepts his fate and sets out to survive. His first idea is to make a copper still and sell brandy for a living. He convinces a banker, Thomasus the Syrian , to lend him Seed money to start his endeavor. He teaches his clerks Arabic numerals and double entry bookkeeping.
Padway eventually develops a printing press , issues newspapers , and builds a crude semaphore telegraph system. However, his attempts to reproduce mechanical clocks , gunpowder , and cannons are failures. He becomes increasingly involved in the politics of the state as Italy is invaded by the Imperials and also threatened from the south and east.
Padway rescues the recently deposed Thiudahad and becomes his quaestor . He uses the king's support to gather forces to defeat the formidable Imperial general Belisarius . Padway managed to surprise Belisarius with tactics never used in the ancient world. Then, deceiving the Dalmatian army, Padway reinstates the senile Thiudahad and imprisons King Wittigis as a hostage. In 537, when Wittigis is killed and Thiudahad descends into madness, Padway has a protÃ©gÃ© of his married off to Mathaswentha and then created king of the Ostrogoths. He also tricks Justinian I into releasing Belisarius from his oath of allegiance and quickly enlists the military genius to command an army against the Franks .
The landing of an Imperial army at Vibo and a rebellion led by the son of Thiudahad threaten the Ostrogothic kingdom and its army is destroyed at Crathis Valley. Padway assembles a new force, spreads an "emancipation proclamation" to the Italian serfs , and recalls Belisarius. The armies clash near Calatia and then Benevento . Despite the lack of discipline by of his Gothic forces, some simple tactical tricks and the nick-of-time arrival of Belisarius secure Padway's victory.
At the end of the novel Padway has stabilized the Italo-Gothic kingdom, introduced a constitution, arranged the end of serfdom, liberated the Burgunds , is having boats built for an Atlantic expedition (Padway wants tobacco ), and has entered negotiations with the Visigothic kingdom in the Iberian peninsula .
Europe will not experience the Dark Ages due to Padway's actions; darkness will not fall.

Related works
A response to this story is "The Deadly Mission of Phineas Snodgrass" by Frederik Pohl , in which a man travels back to 1 BC and teaches modern medicine, causing a population explosion. It ends with the fantastically overpopulated alternate timeline sending someone back to assassinate the title character, allowing darkness to fall for thankful billions. Another is Poul Anderson 's " The Man Who Came Early ", a tale of an American airman sent by a storm to Saga Age Iceland  ; his innovations fail.
A short story sequel to Lest Darkness Fall, "The Apotheosis of Martin Padway", authored by S. M. Stirling , appeared in Harry Turtledove 's 2005 tribute anthology honoring L. Sprague de Camp, The Enchanter Completed . It provides interesting glimpses of what might have become of the reality Padway altered, both during his old age and a few hundred years later.
Another story inspired by Lest Darkness Fall is "To Bring The Light", by David Drake , published together with the original in one book by Baen in 1996. This story features Flavia Herosilla, a well educated woman living in ancient Rome at its height. Like Padway, she is sent back in time by a lightning strike, in her case to the era of Rome's beginnings around 751 BC. Unlike Padway, who tries to change history, Flavia tries to recreate the founding of Rome based on the legends that she knows.
Critical reactions
Jo Walton wrote: "In 1939, L. Sprague de Camp came up with one of the wonderful ideas of science fiction, the man taken out of his time to a time of lower technology ... As soon as Padwayâ€™s there, he puts his head down and starts to concentrate on what makes these books such funâ€”improvising technology from what he knows and can find around him. Padway starts with distilling and double-entry bookkeeping and makes his way up to newspapers and heliographs . ... The more you know history, the more you can see how clever the book is. ... De Camp was a historian of technology. His The Ancient Engineers (1963) is a Eurocentric but nevertheless fascinating non-fiction book." [5]
Boucher and McComas praised the novel as "a witty version of the Connecticut Yankee theme, distinguished by its lore of Gothic Rome." [6] Algis Budrys termed it "marvelous," rating it as "Maybe the best [book] DeCamp ever wrote." [7] P. Schuyler Miller wrote that "Next to Wells's "Time Machine" , this could be the best time-travel novel ever written." [8]
