Plot synopsis
In the desert:
During the early years of the 20th century, a mysterious stranger, Anselmo, whose origins and motives are never explained, builds a popular brothel, the Green House, in the desert on the outskirts of Piura. After her adopted parents are killed by bandits, Antonia (Tonita) is left for dead, her eyes and tongue plucked out by vultures. But she survives and is raised by a poor villager, Juana Barra, until she is abducted by Anselmo, who keeps her in a room in a tower of the Green House as his wife. She dies giving birth to a daughter, Chunga. Outraged, the village priest, Father Garcia, leads the townspeople to burn down the Green House. Grief-stricken, Anselmo becomes a homeless drunkard, supporting himself by playing harp in the townâ€™s bars and brothels. His daughter, Chunga, grows up in this environment and eventually builds a new Green House, where Anselmo plays his music. In the 1930s, a Piruan native, Lituma, joins the military (in a drunken burst of patriotism after the Piruan born colonel, Luis Miguel SÃ¡nchez Cerro , becomes President of Peru through a military coup). Lituma serves in the Amazon region, where he meets his future bride, Bonifacia. They return to Piura and live together until Lituma takes part in a fatal game of Russian roulette and is sentenced to ten years in jail. While he is away, his friends rape Bonifacia, who then becomes a prostitute at the Green House. At novelâ€™s end, Lituma has returned to Piura and is living off his wifeâ€™s income from prostitution.
In the jungle:
During the 1920s, after escaping from prison in Brazil (he had been arrested for accounting theft), Fushia flees to Peru, where he meets a poor water vendor, Aquilino. Together, they trade goods by boat to rubber and timber workers and gold prospectors. Meanwhile, an infant girl, an Aguaruna native (later named Bonifacia), is taken from her father, Jum, to be raised in a mission in Santa MarÃ­a de Nieva. (The nuns â€œcivilizeâ€� the native girls and sell them as house servants.) Fushia once again flees because of his thieving ways and after encountering Huambisa natives, ends up in Iquitos , where with Julio Reategui he takes part in the illegal rubber trade (it is the early 1940s and there is a renewed demand for rubber; since Peru officially is trading rubber only to the Allies, creating a thriving black market). While in Iquitos, Fushia seduces fifteen year-old Lalita. After his role in the black market is discovered, he arranges to trade Lalita to Reategui for a boat and provisions. But Lalita escapes upriver with Fushia. They live on an island on the Santiago River deep within the jungle. Jum, after being educated by two political organizers, creates native co-ops for trading rubber, thus interrupting the system of kickbacks that has enriched Reategui. With a military force led by Reategui, Jum is caught, tortured, and publicly shorn of his hair, an emasculating act to the Aguarauna. Aided by the Huambisa, Fushia assaults native villages, stealing rubber and hides, and abducting barely pubescent girls for his concubines. He is assisted by the humiliated Jum, Aquilino, and Adrian Nieves. Lalita, tired of Fushiaâ€™s abusive ways, escapes with Nieves to Santa Maria de Nieva, where they take in Bonifacia after she has been expelled from the mission for helping newly abducted native girls escape. There she meets and marries Sergeant Lituma. Nieves is eventually sent to jail. Lalita marries one of Litumaâ€™s former comrades. And Fushia, who has contracted leprosy, spends his fortune to covertly enter the leper colony at San Pablo . He lives a lonely life there, visited once a year by his aging friend Aquilino.
