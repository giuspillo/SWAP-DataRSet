Almanac of the Dead is a novel by Leslie Marmon Silko, first published in 1991.
Plot introduction
Almanac of the Dead takes place against the backdrop of the American Southwest and Central America . It follows the stories of dozens of major characters in a somewhat non-linear narrative format. Much of the story takes place in the present day, although lengthy flashbacks and occasional mythological storytelling are also woven into the plot.
The novel's numerous characters are often separated by both time and space, and many seemingly have little to do with one another at first. A majority of these characters are involved in criminal or revolutionary organizations - the extended cast includes arms dealers, drug kingpins, an elite assassin, communist revolutionaries, corrupt politicians and a black market organ dealer.
Driving many of these individual storylines is a general theme of total reclamation of Native American lands.
