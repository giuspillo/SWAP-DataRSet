Story order
In the introduction to the book, King describes the unusual method he used to sort the stories:
"What I did was take all the spades out of a deck of cards plus a joker . Ace to King = 1-13. Joker = 14. I shuffled the cards and dealt them. The order in which they came out of the deck became the order of the stories, based on their position in the list my publisher sent me. And it actually created a very nice balance between the literary stories and the all-out screamers. I also added an explanatory note before or after each story, depending on which seemed the more fitting position. Next collection: selected by Tarot ."
The audiobook versions of the stories in this collection are spread over several products.
