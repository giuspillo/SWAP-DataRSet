The Dead of Jericho is a work of English detective fiction by Colin Dexter, the fifth part of the Inspector Morse series, which was subsequently the first of a highly successful series of television adaptations of the novels.
Plot summary

Six months later Anne Scott is found hanging in her kitchen at 9 Canal Reach, Jericho , Oxford . Initially Chief Inspector Bell, from the closer Oxford Central station on St. Aldate's Street , is assigned to the case; but a fortnight later Morse takes over the investigation and subsequently both of Mrs Murdoch's sons, Edward "Ted" Murdoch and Michael Murdoch, as well as Anne Scott's former employers, brothers Charles Richards and Conrad Richards, and Charles's wife, Celia, come to the attention of Morse. As do Ms Scott's neighbours, including the nosy handyman George Jackson, and Sophocles 's Oedipus Rex (the latter also figures in episode 3.1 of the spin-off TV series Lewis ).
