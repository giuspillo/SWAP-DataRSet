Catch-22 is a satirical and somewhat historical novel by the American author Joseph Heller. He began writing it in 1953, and the novel was first published in 1961. It is set during World War II in 1943 and is frequently cited as one of the great literary works of the twentieth century. It uses a distinctive non-chronological third-person omniscient narration, describing events from different characters' points of view and out of sequence so that the time line develops along with the plot. The novel follows Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier. Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th squadron is based on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean Sea west of Italy. The novel looks into the experiences of Yossarian and the other airmen in the camp, and their attempts to keep their sanity in order to fulfill their service requirements, so that they can return home. The phrase "Catch-22", "a problematic situation for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule," has entered the English language.
Influences
Heller wanted to be a writer from an early age; his experiences as a bombardier during World War II inspired Catch-22; [14] Heller later said that he "never had a bad officer." In a 1977 essay on Catch-22, Heller stated that the "antiwar and antigovernment feelings in the book" were a product of the Korean War and the 1950s rather than World War II itself. Heller's criticisms are not intended for World War II but for the Cold War and McCarthyism . [15]
The influence of the 1950s on Catch-22 is evident through Heller's extensive use of anachronism . Though the novel is ostensibly set in World War II, Heller intentionally included anachronisms like loyalty oaths and computers (IBM machines) to situate the novel in the context of the 1950s. [9] Many of the characters are based on or connected to individuals from the 1950s:
Milo Minderbinder's maxim "What's good for M&M Enterprises is good for the country" alludes to former president of General Motors Charles Erwin Wilson 's statement before the Senate "What's good for General Motors is good for the country." [9]
The question of "Who promoted Major Major ?" alludes to Joseph McCarthy 's questioning of the promotion of Major Peress , an army dentist who refused to sign loyalty oaths. [9]
Czech writer ArnoÅ¡t Lustig recounts in his book 3x18 that Joseph Heller told him that he would never have written Catch-22 had he not first read The Good Soldier Å vejk by Jaroslav HaÅ¡ek . [16]
In 1998, some critics raised the possibility that Heller's book had questionable similarities to Louis Falstein 's 1950 novel, Face of a Hero . Falstein never raised the issue between Catch-22's publication and his death in 1995 and Heller claimed never to have been aware of the obscure novel. Heller said that the novel had been influenced by CÃ©line , Waugh and Nabokov . Many of the similarities have been stated to be attributable to the authors' experiences, both having served as U.S. Air Force aircrew in Italy in World War II. However, their themes and styles are different. [17]
Literary allusions
Catch-22 contains allusions to many works of literature. Howard Jacobson , in his 2004 introduction to the Vintage Classics publication, wrote that the novel was "positioned teasingly ... between literature and literature's opposites â€“ between Shakespeare and Rabelais and Dickens and Dostoevsky and Gogol and CÃ©line and the Absurdists and of course Kafka on the one hand, and on the other vaudeville and slapstick and Bilko and Abbott and Costello and Tom and Jerry and the Goons (if Heller had ever heard of the Goons)." [18] One critic argues that it is Kafka's influence that can be seen most strongly in the novel:
Like Kafka's heroes, Yossarian is riddled with anxiety and caught in an inexorable nightmare â€“ in his case created by Colonel Cathcart and the inevitability of him raising the number of missions he has to fly. [19]
Historical context
The idea for Catch-22 was based on Joseph Heller's personal experience in World War II. The feelings that Yossarian and the other bomber pilots felt were taken directly from problems he suffered while on duty. Heller flew 60 bombing missions from May to October in 1944. Heller mentions that he should have been killed three times over, since the average death rate was 5% per mission. Heller was able to make it out of the war, but the experience tortured him and it took until 1953 before he could start writing about it. The war experience turned Heller into a "tortured, funny, deeply peculiar human being". [20]
After publication in 1961, Catch-22 became very popular among teenagers at the time. Catch-22 seemed to embody the feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. It was joked around that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy of Catch-22. The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to over eight million copies being sold in the United States. There are many[ who? ][ not in citation given ] who feel that "the comic fable that ends in horror has become more and more clearly a reflection of the altogether uncomic and horrifying realities of the world in which we live and hope to survive." [21]
Explanation of the novel's title
The title is a reference to a fictional bureaucratic stipulation which embodies forms of illogical and immoral reasoning. The opening chapter of the novel was originally published in New World Writing as Catch-18 in 1955, but Heller's agent, Candida Donadio, requested that he change the title of the novel, so it would not be confused with another recently published World War II novel, Leon Uris 's Mila 18 . The number 18 has special meaning in Judaism (it means Alive in Gematria ; see Chai ) and was relevant to early drafts of the novel which had a somewhat greater Jewish emphasis. [22]
The title Catch-11 was suggested, with the duplicated 1 paralleling the repetition found in a number of character exchanges in the novel, but because of the release of the 1960 movie Ocean's Eleven , this was also rejected. Catch-17 was rejected so as not to be confused with the World War II film Stalag 17 , as was Catch-14, apparently because the publisher did not feel that 14 was a " funny number ." Eventually the title came to be Catch-22, which, like 11, has a duplicated digit, with the 2 also referring to a number of dÃ©jÃ  vu -like events common in the novel. [22]
Publication & Movie Rights
Catch-22 was sold to Simon & Schuster , where it had been championed by editor Robert Gottlieb , who would edit and oversee the marketing of the book. Nina Bourne also participated in editing the book. Officially published on 10 October 1961, the hardcover sold for $5.95. The book was not a best-seller in hardcover in the United States. Though it sold 12,000 copies by Thanksgiving, it never entered the New York Times Bestseller List . Catch-22 got good notices and was nominated for the National Book Award in March 1962. (Heller lost out to Walker Percy 's The Moviegoer .) It went through four printings in hardcover, but only sold well on the East Coast. The book never established itself nationally until it was published in paperback for 75 cents. [23]
Upon publication in Great Britain, the book became the #1 best-seller. [23] Don Fine of Dell Paperbacks bought the paperback reprint rights to Catch-22 for $32,000. Between the paperback's release in September 1962 and April 1963, it sold 1.1 million copies. [23] In August 1962, Donadio brokered the sale of movie rights to Columbia Pictures for $100,000 plus $25,000 to write a treatment or a first draft of a screenplay. [23]
Reception
The initial reviews of the book ranged from very positive to very negative. There were positive reviews from The Nation , ("the best novel to come out in years"), the New York Herald Tribune ("A wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller-coaster of a book") and The New York Times ("A dazzling performance that will outrage nearly as many readers as it delights"). On the other hand, The New Yorker , ("doesn't even seem to be written; instead, it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper," "what remains is a debris of sour jokes") and a second review from the New York Times ("repetitive and monotonous. Or one can say that it is too short because none of its many interesting characters and actions is given enough play to become a controlling interest") [24] disliked it. One commentator of Catch-22 recognized that "many early audiences liked the book for just the same reasons that caused others to hate it" [25] The book had a cult following though, especially among teenagers and college students. Heller remarks that in 1962, after appearing on the Today show he went out drinking with the host at the time, John Chancellor, who handed him stickers that Chancellor got privately printed reading "YOSSARIAN LIVES". Heller also said that Chancellor had been secretly putting them on the walls of the corridors and executive bathrooms in the NBC building. [25]
Although the novel won no awards upon release, it has remained in print and is seen as one of the most significant American novels of the 20th century. [3] Scholar and fellow World War II veteran Hugh Nibley said it was the most accurate book he ever read about the military. [26] Since its release in 1961, the book has sold 10 million copies.
