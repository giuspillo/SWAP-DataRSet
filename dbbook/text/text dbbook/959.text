Notes on a few known translation errors
A few translation errors are known from the 1978 English translation original edition. One small error, biographically significant for the author, is the name of his University teacher and mentor Dr. Makoto Hiura (æ¨‹æµ¦ èª , hiura makoto ? ) (1898â€“1991); a Japanese scholar and academic leader, including as one of the founders of Rakuno Gakuen University in 1960, and later its first president. [1]
After being corrected, the respective sentence straddling this 1978 edition's pages 4â€“5 will read: "I had studied plant pathology under Dr. Makoto Hiura, a teacher at Gifu Agricultural High School" (instead of: "â€¦ Makoto Okera â€¦").
