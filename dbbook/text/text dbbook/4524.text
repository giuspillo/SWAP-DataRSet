Frog and Toad Are Friends is the first Book in the Frog and Toad trilogy published in 1970 by the American author of children's stories, Arnold Lobel. This is a cute collection of stories about friendship and the many adventures that their friendship takes them upon. The artwork is very sweet and imaginative and brings a strong moral message to children of the importance of strong friendships. The vocabulary is easy to read without being patronizing to the point that it would put off its readers. This book is perfect for the young readers and will delight them as well as inspire them.
